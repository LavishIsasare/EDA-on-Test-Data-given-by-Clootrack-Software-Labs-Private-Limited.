"The hotel was adequate for my stay. The strips in the bathtub were useless as I fell while taking a shower. I asked the front desk staff several times to get a bath mat but they never did. Management was unresponsive to my request which was very poor; someone should have gone to a dollar store and gotten a bath mat. Breakfast was good but it would have been nice to have had yogurt and/or cottage cheese on the buffet.

"It was great for what we needed, a place to sleep. Parking was 20 a day, which isn’t too bad for that area. We were on the floor that the pool was located on, so there was a constant flow of loud people storming down the hallway. Poorly set up, since that is the only way to the pool. They probably put us there since we used a third party booking site.

"The room is tiny. The building is old and worn on inside. Needs updating. The walls are thin. The bathroom needs updating. Flooring is worn and ripping. Staff wasn’t the friendliest. Plan on walking 25 minutes to time square. Security was the only good thing with this hotel. Be prepared they add on fees if you purchase through Expedia. They call it resort fees. Why, I have no idea. It’s not a resort.

When I called the front desk about the extra bed I requested, it was explained to me since we have two beds they could not accommodate us with a rollaway. Why give that an option during booking but not available during the stay? Overall it was a nice experience.

"Sent my parents on an anniversary trip, They wanted to stay local but wanted to get away from the heat in Riverside so they stayed here for two days. They said the property was secluded, clean and they felt safe in this area. The hotel itself was clean, comfortable and they had a nice view. The staff were friendly and found their reservation with no issues. ONLY downside is that they had to pay $20 per day for parking. The parking was private and they didn't worry about their car being broken into so that was a plus but it was an extra cost we didn't expect. Great location for site seeing.

"This property is advertised as being renovated. Only four floors are renovated and a renovation means basically new bedding. There were stains on the ceiling, a leaking shower, toilet that didn't work, peeling paint and an unpleasant manager when we asked to change our room. He seemed to think a non-working toilet wasn't an issue. I would not recommend nor ever stay in this property again. It was very disappointing.

"L’unica cosa accettabile è stata la cortesia ricevuta al check out. Tutto il resto da cancellare. Camera vecchia, male insonorizzata mobili vecchi e maltenuti, illuminazione fatta malissimo e, nonostante tutto abbiamo faticato a farcela assegnare. La prima camera che abbiamo ricevuto è al piano della strada con i parcheggi a 50 metri, questa camera è maleodorante di con mobili vecchi e scrostati. Guardate attentamente le condizioni perché compaiono 25$/giorno per i servizi che dicono di offrire come ad esempio la navetta per i parchi ma non è così. Le navette non servono i parchi degli Universal Studios e non servono l’aeroporto quindi l’unico modo per spostarsi è il taxi peraltro abbastanza costoso. Una mattina si sono inventati un aumento di $ 11 + tasse e mancia al 18% a persona a perché ospitavano alcuni osceni personaggi Disney !!!

Worst of all the assistant I had was horrible at service. She was rude and unattentive. Felt rushed and she didn't try to give us any information at all about the hotel except where our room is at. They only accept strictly Debit cards and some major credit cards only with a $50-100 dollars deposit depending on if you have kids or not with you. If only the attendant that helped me was more friendly I wouldn't mind so much all the other flaws... But in all honesty I didn't even get a smile from her and I booked 4 rooms. But I'm not saying all employees are like that but I can say I never gotten any kind of acknowledgement from any of the employees who works there. No one greets.

 There were stinky fruits all over the pool areas. They just tried to blow them under the bushes. STINKY!
 I needed my safe opened, and it took a long time to get them to do it. Most of the room was clean except mold in the shower. It rained a lot and there were NO inside activities. How about yoga or Zumba in the rainy season? I definitely Won't be back.

"1st off - I knew right away I wouldn’t be staying at this property again. Right after check in, we go to self park, only to find out that we weren’t given a code for the gate. Go up to Valet, get the code, go get in our room. Mind you, self parking and our room were on COMPLETELY opposite sides of the hotel property. Next, I realize I was charged for parking and forgot to mention that we had a handicap tag. I call the front desk, explain, and get told that I would get a refund to the card I put on file. Sounds great, problem solved. Next day, hadn’t received any notification for the refund and ALSO got a notice on our car that it was going to get towed because I didn’t have a parking tag on the dash.....when I wasn’t given anything by the front desk. I go talk to the front desk after our morning at the park & they say that they do charge for handicap and end up giving me a parking tag. Overall, it was not worth even the small cost of the stay. If staying at this property for Disney benefits- I suggest looking into a Disney Value resort. The inside of the hotel room just in general felt damp. Comforters on the beds were both damp. Friendliness of the staff was much less than acceptable, and I did not enjoy getting wrong information and a threat to tow my vehicle when it was their mistake.

"I stayed on a groumd floor room near the pool and have to say as a hotel with the word Disney associated this is the most disappointing hotel i stayed in orlando. The room smelled musty, the AC was loud and frequently went on and off, almost no sound proofing between the door and outside so heard every child or pool activity. Overall the room I'd say was nothing more then a new paint job.

"The property is in a nice neighborhood with restaurants, retail shopping and easy access to public transportation. The facility was only about twenty minutes from LaGuardia airport which was convenient after a long day of travel. The hotel was clean and check in was easy with the staff. They ran out of room card so we only had one during our stay which was fine because we were together coming and going. They did tell us to check back in the morning after our check in but we didn’t check back. 
 
 We had a king size bed in our room which was very comfortable. The bathroom was small as you had to wedge yourself in the corner to shut or open the door but the shower was nice and the sink area as well. The mirror also lit up without the main light as well which was a nice feature. 
 
 Nice flat screen tv mounted on the wall and a wardrobe provided because there wasn’t a closet. We made use of a corner in the room for our large luggage and had plenty of cubby holes for clothing and shoes. 
 
 Breakfast was also provided every morning which was a great way to start the day not having to worry about food for a good part of the day. The only negative was that it was the same foods everyday in a buffet style. 
 
 Overall for the price, room features, neighborhood location and breakfast I would stay here again. I really liked that there wasn’t carpet on the floor either.

When I booked the 2 rooms 1 for my family and 1 for my Aunt and Uncle it says we are getting a King size bed but when we got in our rooms it appears to be a Queen size bed, both rooms. Then trying to use the phone in our room but its not working and I have to go to my Aunt's room to use there phone then I have to wait for them to ring me back but I decided to go down to the front desk then they told me that it is a King size bed and also they told me they can't transfer us because they are fully book. The rooms are both accessible and very spacious. It looks clean but I have seen some water stain in the ceiling. We slept alright its comfortable enough. Staff are friendly.

"I would only recommend this hotel due to its location. Its right in front of the Madison Square Garden and has a lot of metro entrances close which makes it easier to commute. However, there are some hotel features which are not the best. The rooms are extremely small. I went with my boyfriend so overall it was fine but it was already a small room for the two of us. They didn't clean the room very well. Also, we were on the 30th floor and to wait for the elevators was a complete nightmare. One day we had to spent 15 minutes waiting for an elevator with enough space to be able to go down and then another day we had to wait 30 minutes in the lobby to be able to go up. The elevators need major improvement since they are really slow and they are always crowded.

"Our first room was basically in the parking lot. It was incredibly loud until about 1am and then again beginning at 5am. We barely got any sleep. This was due not only to location, but mostly due to the fact that the seal of the door was non-existent. We could see light all the way around it. They did let us change rooms. This new room was in a better location, but was still very loud. Also, as soon as you check in they try to con you into a timeshare. We also had dried blood stains on our comforter. We could not wait until check-out. I mean this hotel is cheaper than others in the area, but it was a terrible experience. Not worth the savings!!!!

"The picture on Expedia was misleading to actual property. The photo of the lobby was accurate, however. The location is great and the grounds are well kept. The actual room was a bit different. The bathroom was extremely small with little room to move let alone fit two guests. The bathtub was cracked/peeling off in one corner and there were stains on the tub floor. Also, there was no mirror in the room aside from the mirror in the bathroom which wasn't conductive to two guests. We most likely won't be staying at this location again.

The room was nicely updated and quite- except for the air conditioning unit. That thing rattled on and off throughout the night. But we were so exhausted from being in the parks all day that it didn’t wake us after the first night. Walking to the parks took about 10 minuets. The room was spacious and didn’t feel cramped with four people moving around. The bathroom was nice and clean with decent counter space. Shower was big and had enough room to move without touching the sides. Could use more places to put your stuff on though. Very small corner shelf so had things on the shower floor. 
 First time staying here but won’t be our last.

"The Wyndham has gone back. The room was awful. The toilet kept breaking and on the last day they decided to turn off the water mid way through a shower without notifying the guests. In addition a cockroach was also seen in the bath tub. Around the pool it’s pretty much look after yourself. There is no one coming round taking drink orders and there is no amenity to blow up your child’s floaty. The surface of the pool is in need of some TLC. I have stayed here so many times but this will be my last time as the hotel has seriously gone back. The breakfast is very basic and you constantly have to remind the servers about your breakfast order. We asked for an omelette and 20 mins later it was still not out and then when it finally did it was the wrong one. Just not good enough.

"The property was great but we had issues with the day shift and not getting a room for over 5 hours. When we arrived the ""system just went down"", and no rooms were able to be given. I was told to write my name and phone number on a piece of computer paper and they would call when the system was back up. We checked our bags at the baggage counter and waited 1.5 hours before we got tired of waiting and went to the park. After 5 hours we returned from the park and the system was back up, no call or anything. I have a 7 and 5 yr old and we just flew from KC and they were dirty and tired.The day manager stated that he couldn't comp the room for the night because he didn't have authority to do so but gave us a free breakfast. He gave us a room key and when we got to the room and tried to go in there was someone already in the room, this was at 12:00am. I returned to the front desk and the night manager was there and he upgraded us to the tower, ok that's fine. We get to the 10th floor tried the key, it didn't work. So I had to drag my kids and wife back down to the lobby. This time he gave us a room key that worked but we still didn't know where bags were. The night manager was awesome. He ,for some reason, had the ""authority"" to comp us 2 nights and give us another free breakfast. The night manager was a great help and did everything he could to make sure he cleaned up the other managers mess. He even brought our bags to our room personally. He was the best part of the hotel.

"The toilet handle in our room broke off on first use. We called room service to fix it while we were at the pool and they didn't come. Then we asked the front desk again to see if they could fix it while we went out. We got back four hours later and it was never fixed. We had to open up the top of the toilet every time to flush it. It was super annoying. 
 
 Also parking is not included in the price and it's $20. That sucked.

"I really liked this hotel and will probably book there again. Amenities are awesome, overall hotel is very nice, the reason i reviewed as i did was because when we arrived, the hotel staff told us that they overbooked and we were going to have to be moved from room to room in the middle of our stay. With children, that sucks. But we didn’t have a choice. We booked so long in advance there was no way another hotel would be the same price and the area was pretty sold out. So we bit the bullet. BUT the next morning we went downstairs and the staff at the counter had no idea what we were talking about, then informed us that there were no other rooms to move us to, which is great! It was just an inconvenience we had to stay packed for a day thinking we’d be moving rooms and then when addressed no one knew what we were talking about. Also, breakfast at the Summit restaurant in the same parking lot. We got the continental and it was just fruit and a fruit pastry. I paid for a different breakfast but it was ridiculously priced. If we weren’t staying at the hotel, two bowls of fruit, two pastries, two plates of biscuits and gravy would have been $65!!! Luckily it was not that much since we were staying there. So, other than that miscommunication at the front. The hotel was one of the nicer ones we’ve ever stayed in with our kids.

"I stayed here with my girlfriend for her birthday. Prior to my stay I messaged the hotel about any additions for the birthday that if they added I would pay for in advance and appreciate. None of that happened. Upon check in the front desk woman was coarse and seemed overworked. I had questions about the amenities and she quickly averted the topic. The bartenders in the lobby were nice but it seemed that everyone was from another country(that’s all they talked about). That’s fine with me but it became noticably worse when they were arriving to work visibly hung over. 
 
 The “resort” is fine. At check in we were handed a map that let us know where everything was. There was a quiet pool On that map that we were looking forward to, however the reality is that it was unmonitored and often over run by kids and louder adults. The same with the hot tub. There is no spa here despite what is advertised. There is a small gym open to anyone and a sauna - and during our stay there were kids everywhere so we didn’t bother to use these features. Also - there are ducks on the property. For me and my girl we enjoyed them and know that in Florida wildlife comes with staying anywhere. However it was really disheartening to see kids and young adults violently chasing them away at times. It the hotel can staff some outdoor attendants to inform and assist with how the resort should run, our stay would have probably been a lot better

"En la llegada nos dieron un desayuno y un upgrade gratis de la habitación que implicaba mejores vistas (debido a que nos dieron una habitación en la que estaban trabajando en ese momento). Las habitaciones son pequeñas pero muy correctas, los pasillos son un poco mas antiguos pero importa poco. Hay que tener en cuenta que el mismo edificio alberga distintos tipos de alojamientos a distintos precios (incluyendo albergues para joven) aunque los distintos huespedes nunca se mezclan en la misma planta pero le da al conjunto un ambiente peculiar. La limpieza es impecables en las habitaciones y la ubicación es inmejorable. La relación calidad-precio (al menos el que pagamos) lo hace 100% recomendable si uno no espera un 4 estrellas con estándar español.

The staff are always friendly and helpful. This trip I thought I had booked a double room but had actually book a single room with a double bed (it was definitely my error). While my friend that was with me is like a brother to me, I didn't fancy sleeping with him during our stay. However, the staff were able to find us a double room, much to my delight. I highly recommend this hotel as it is my hotel of choice when staying in New York.

"Please read the fine print BEFORE choosing this hotel. Yes its close to Disney Springs, but you dont get much for the money you spend. While the pool is nice, the rooms are oit dated and dirty. Dont bother ordering room service and if your a soda drinker, BRING YOUR OWN!!! last night i ordered a meal to split between myself and my young daughter. I splurged a bit and got the steak and potatoes. They asked what drink we wanted. I ordered a pepsi and a sprite. To my surprise, a CAN NOT BOTTLE was $5.00 A PIECE! Which meant $10.00 for two cans of soda... TALK ABOUT ROBBERY. The steak I ordered was $32, but once the cokes were added plus 18% for them walking it up, our bill for one plated meal was $61.00. >< The bus transport they offer to the parks is ridiculous and the drivers are rude(even to children) and they are always late. They also leave when people are walking/running up flagging them down to wait. (Saw this on multiple occasions during our three day stay) 
 Nothing in this hotel is disney themed other than the ""store"" down stairs. Oh! And the fees to stay here are outrageous. $25 a night resort fee, but you also HAVE to pay $20 a day to park your car, even if you park it. So for three nights, we had to pay, $75 in resort fees and $60 to park our car. $135 on top of what we paid for the room which was a little over $350 bucks. We could have just stayed on actual property and had a nice room with kind bus drivers for that price, but live and learn i guess. LIVID.

"We were only comfortable 1 of the 7 nights we stayed in this hotel. I rented two rooms, both were changed day 3 due to cold showers the prior two nights. Then the hot water in the entire hotel went out and they lied for several hours before it was fixed instructing is to run the water for 15 minutes, just 2 more minutes...until I went to the desk and they finally said the repair had just begun. Another cold shower, and left in the morning. When we returned, the bed had water on it dripping from the air conditioner vent and the AC was not working correctly. Since it couldn’t be fixed, all furniture was moved to the side out of the drip area which meant I couldn’t sit on the bed without hitting my head on a light, and no AC for that evening. The next day they lied again saying it had been fixed. I had to call for them to move the furniture back and then looked up to see more water on the vent. We pushed the furniture over ourselves and slept like that the rest of our stay, without the AC working properly. After talking to every single manager and getting nowhere I had to wait two hours one morning day 6 to speak to the director of operations who all but accused me of lying because why would he “take a customers word over his employees?” He took 6 days off of one of my rooms. My second room that had been changed the same day as the first smelled like rotten eggs the entire time but maintenance did nothing and the director of operations wasn’t willing to do anything.

The hotel's gym is pretty big and comes with a lot of treadmills and other equipment.

"We are SoCal residents and Disney pass holders. We frequently visit the parks but only occasionally stay in Anaheim due to the high room rates. That being said, we have stayed at several properties local to the parks over the years but this was our first time at this hotel. It will NOT be our last! In fact, this will be our go to hotel from here on out. From great rates compared to other area hotels (we paid $151 when other hotels were charging $199+ for the same night), to brand new and supremely clean facilities (lobby, pool, and room), to free parking, no resort fee, and excellent customer service from Stacy and her team. We WILL be back. Highly recommend it! The whole property is newly renovated. The rooms were clean and large. We had 2 queens and a pull out couch with a view of the pool. We used the pool which was heated. The pool area was clean and well stocked with towels. There is gated underground parking and we were able to leave our car in the garage as we enjoyed the parks after check out and returned to get our vehicle around 10pm. We walked to Garden Walk for dinner as well as to and from Disneyland. We were greeted each time by every employee we encountered. Definitely will plan on using this hotel as our Disney spot from here on out.

Once I was on my floor, I had to turn several corners and go down short hallways to my room which felt very unsafe. As a single woman, I don't want to be trapped in a corner with someone I don't know (which happened). I would not recommend staying here.

"Staff service was excellent. Pool area is very nice. Lobby bar is small but enjoyable. The elevators to the first 5 floors is excruciatingly slow. The room was clean but extremely small. If you are a family with 1-2 children you must get a second room. The double beds are too small for two normal sized adults. The pool snack bar has great service and the food is actually pretty good.

When I picked this hotel I did NOT realize the stark difference in staying in the garden section vd towers as this is not expressed in any of the booking material. Pool was fine, we are 2 adults with no kids so there was no section to get away from the constant massive floats that can be rented and splashing/yellind children.... Pool said it closed at 9pm and all you heard until 11pm at least, were screeching kids in the pool I. The garden section.

"I did not like house keeping. They were rude and non- compliant with noise. One staff had music playing while she was cleaning and they were yelling to each other across the hall about non work related conversations.
 
 It was so loud we have to walk out and open the door to tell them we are trying to sleep. I was in disbelief that it was house keeping and not just other people at the property. 
 
 Then the other issue I had was we found a roach running around on the carpet and I took a photo of the roach and killed it. 
 
 The carpet of my room 156 looked dingy and worn down, I was very displeased with my stay to the point where the price was way to high for a Wyndham, or did Wyndham just hit an all time low. I truly felt like I was at a motel 6 or lower. 
 
 All in all not happy about the accommodation, and truly displeased. I guess it’s my fault for not reading reviews while booking.

 The air-condition went out, and they said they would send a service man to reset it, but he never showed up to the room. We had to crack the door to let the cold air from the hall try to cool down the room. I was not the only person that had issues with this problem.
 I have sent an email to who the manager gave me the email address, and no reply whatsoever! That tells me they don’t really care about the customers!
 At this point, I would not recommend this Hotel to any of my friends going to New York. The price was way too high for the service we received.

"Checked into our room and 5pm and immediately left to go shopping turning the AC on before we left to cool the room down. Got back around midnight to find the room was still 78 degrees. First we thought maybe we set the AC wrong and gave it 20 minutes to see if it would cool down. After the wait time , the temp had increased by 2 degrees and was now over 80. We called the front desk and told them of the situation. They had a maintenance guy come up to the room who was instantly able to tell that the AC was broke?(no room check before guest check in ?) he said he would be able to fix it but it would take some time and as it was already 1am and we had just drove 17 hours we were very tired and just wanted to sleep so we asked to switch rooms. We were then forced to pack all of our belongings that we had just unpacked a few hours earlier and lug all of our luggage to the front desk lobby to switch rooms.by this point it was almost 2am and we were given a new room with a working AC unit and weren’t able to get settled into our room til about 230am.

"This hotel is one of the best deals you can find to stay on the resort. However, don’t get fooled by the reception that is shared with the higher end Wyndham lake Buena Vista. The Wyndham Garden is dated, and let’s say not much love or attention is being put in.
 
 As soon as you check in, you’ll be dragged to a counter of someone who, by bribing you with restaurant coupons, will actually try to sell you membership to their Club. To access the “Sunset” part or the resort, take an elevator (that’s probably one of the slowest on the planet). It took us more than 4 minutes to get the elevator and go down one floor. If you don’t have have luggage.
 
 An old, dusty smell will great you in a yellowish setting that is your room. And probably your neighbors will greet you too because the walls are so thin. The room is however very clean and the bed is comfortable. There is a serious lack of power plug near the bed. Thanks to an ingenious setup of MacBook and a lot of cables, we were able to charge 3 devices at night. 
 
 We grabbed a muffin at their “cafe”. It was probably from three days ago.
 
 The day of the checkout, if you’re not already up thanks to your neighbors alarm clock, expect to be waken up at 8:30am by staff knocking & asking you when you expect to be leaving. Please, don’t blame the staff — they’re just following management instructions.
 
 Checkout experience was a “You’re good to go” mumbling. No room for feedback there.
 
 Magical stay.

"After staying here several times during the past six years, this was likely our final stay. The location is excellent, it's about a five minute walk to Disney Springs. The pool is great and has a section that's wonderful for kids. The food at the pool, although a little pricey, is pretty good. Both the park shuttles and beds were great.
 
 However, the last two times we have stayed the housekeeping has been less than ideal. I gave them the benefit of the doubt last time and thought maybe we had the same housekeeper every time and they were just having some bad days but it happened this trip too. The tile floors were not cleaned during our stay and we had two people with long hair. The tub did not seem to get cleaned because a rusty stain started appearing from the dripping however I think they did try because two days when we came back for the evening, the tub was plugged and water was standing in it. We had the garden view on our other trips and this time we were stuck in the back by the employee parking. We missed the view but thought maybe it would be quieter since less people were walking past, etc. But the car alarms all night made up for it. The hotel room wasn't showing too much wear other than the tub definitely needed to be refinished as there were several peeling spots.
 
 I have recommended this hotel to many people due to our previous experiences however this trip was disappointing and for a small amount more, next time will stay on property.

Will likely not stay here if we are visiting for more than 1 day unless the umbrella situation is resolved.

"Overall, it was a very nice resort. This trip was a surprise for my daughter's 17th birthday and I would like to give a special thanks to Deborah and Ali at Tesoro Cove who brought her out a cupcake and sang happy birthday to her ! She really loved it and nothing really phases her (not even the surprise trip) ! 
 .....I feel like there should have been a shuttle bus to Universal Studios from the resort as well as to Disney. The shuttle buses eliminate the costly expense of parking.
 .....I ordered room service two of the nights that we stayed and I was under the impression the charges were take from my account at the time the food was delivered but when I checked out, I was given the bill for room service and other charges. I was not given the option of having it debited from credit card and I would have preferred that to having more charges added to my already expensive bill.
 Maybe I misunderstood but I thought when I booked the trip through Expedia that everything except resort fees were paid for but when I checked in I was charged another $300 which was refunded but I was not prepared for that, I could have budgeted a little better for the trip.
  Nevertheless, it was taken care of. My next trip will be a planned a little better and I will stay somewhere a little less expensive and somewhere that provides transportation to more places. Considering we were out all day, I didn't need such a fancy resort. I still think the resort was beautiful and staff are very friendly.

"This is my second stay at the New Yorker and I will definitely be back! 
 I stay here when seeing a show at the Garden, and the location really can't be beat if that is why you are in town. 
 The A,C,E subway line is literally around the corner and if that doesn't suit your fancy, Penn Station is just a block up where you can catch any number of trains. 
 
 The staff are always friendly and willing to help. Lobby is perfectly airconditioned which is great on Summer days!
 Be aware if you want to check in early, they want 50 bucks to do so.
 Bed was comfy, and I didn't hear any noise from hallway/neighbors. 
 My room was 9th floor I think, and there was still considerable noise from the street. Nothing that ear plugs couldn't fix.
 
 The elevators, despite being numerous, notoriously run slow. 
 Rooms do not have fridge or microwaves.
 Those are really the only downsides. 
 Honestly, if you are coming from out of town to see a show at the Garden and the room rates are reasonable? STAY HERE
 You'll love it. 
 5 whole steps above Hotel Penn!!

When I I called front desk and inquired with house keeping for the missing items, the response received was well you’re going to check out soon so you don’t need it. I’m big on customer service, especially since the expectation is great hospitality since you’re staying in an Inn or hotel.

The rooms seemed a little outdated, we stayed in an outside room (our door didn’t exit to an interior corridor) and our room never got cold, we had the ac running constantly. But the room was great because we brought our dog along and it was very easy to walk her with the exterior room. Also, our bathroom fan didn’t work which was strange. So besides the AC, the bathroom fan, and the semi out of date rooms, the hotel is nice! No signs in the lobby tho for check in etc, the pool was great, the gatorville restaurant was our go to for breakfast because everything was already prepared and not expensive at all. The fitness center was tiny! Not sufficient for a leg or back workout, and the WiFi in our room was horrible, not only that but sometimes our phone wouldn’t receive service either. Uber has no problem picking us up or dropping off. The hotel is also near a bunch of restaurants for convenience.

"Arrived at 11:30am last Saturday and was told check-in was at 4pm. (There was also a group of over 100 loud girls in the lobby so this was a tad annoying.) OK. At 3:55, we went to the front desk and the room was still not ready. First red flag. There was another family ahead of us who seemed to have the same issue and they arrived at noon. I went back in line after 4PM and again, room wasn't ready. It was at this point that I ""asked to speak to the manager"" 20 minute wait and no manger came out but the front desk all of a sudden had a room ready for us. We went to the room and wow, the madness continues. There were bugs in the room, the toilet wouldn't flush, the safe was not working and the hotel room looked like a dump. It didn't look like what I had reserved. I called front desk to speak to the manager and we switched our room to another one and was told that there were two buildings for the hotel and we were in the one I did not request. We were told we could switch to tower next day at no extra cost.The next day, we go to Epcot and come back to pick up our rooms keys. 9th floor in the tower. We fall asleep and not an hour later we keep hearing loud girls in the hall slamming doors, singing, and one point, music. It went on the whole night. Why were we placed on the 9th floor with the 100 girls. This area should have been blocked for them. Next day at breakfast, we were asked how our night was and we said it was terrible due to noise from the teens and even the STAFF knew

There are rules but the staff does not enforce them so there really arent any rules. Kids jumping and diving in the pools and lazy river. Parents dont watch their kids.

"Location couldn’t be better. Very close to trains, walkable to Lower East side, Soho, Little Italy as well as In Chinatown. Great access to restaurants and shops. Really nice people working in the hotel, too. But the pullout sofa bed was terrible—our son ended up sleeping on the floor because he said it was better than the terrible mattress. Also, just one drawer in the closet, and it was odd to put clothes in desk and nightstands. There was room for a small dresser in the suite so this seemed like an oversight. But a mostly pleasant stay.

"First, let me start off by saying that I have NEVER liked this cheap looking hotel. I was there in 2003, and my keycard kept deactivating on its own. Now, in 2019, it did it again. I see you haven't upgraded. But this is not about the keycard. This is about your silly ""Facility Fee."" Exactly, WHAT FACILITIES did I use??? The toilet? I was under the impression that that was covered in the regular hotel fee! We got no complimentary coffee. No hair dryer in our room. No complimentary breakfast in the lobby either. So what did my facility fee cover? That was never explained. The only thing we ""used"" was the bed, bathroom and tv, which comes with any hotel room, and should be included in the price of the hotel. Those shouldn't be considered as, ""extras"" or ""facility fees."" Moreover, Expedia advertises this scummy hotel as having free WIFI. Hmmm. So if that's part of the facility fee, then it's NOT FREE! I've been to NY LOTS of times. No hotel has ever charged this ridiculous fee! It's like, you charged me twice for the same room. The only reason I picked this hotel, was because with the Pride festivities going on, everything was booked, or the prices were higher than usual. This hotel was advertised as $101/night on Expedia. My brother paid for me and his daughter (my niece) to stay there for 2-nights. The price was $268 total. That should've covered everything that comes with the hotel!

"Very disappointing stay. The property is clearly poorly managed by a Chinese. Manager and this is evident in every respect. Examples: when arrived my 2 beds room was not available since the property manager had “guests” in the hotel not registered that had taken my room (and another); I was given my key and when I eneterd my room it was occupied and this is how the unregistered guest were discovered .... I was changed into 2 room (disappointing as I was with my kids). The new room had dirty bedsheets, no toilet paper and door lock not functioning (not nice given that somebody maybe issued a key for an occupied roon as it happend to me). The next day when I returned to the room the room was not done.... I called and the reception required me to go down and get keys for another room.. I was extremely disappointed to be forced to change again the room.... but there was no way to stay in my room sunce they would not make it therefore me and my kids had to move to another room (this time 2 beds)... The new room had the phone not working. In summary a poorly managed property, a lot of staff is Chinese as well and speek little or broken English and keeps the property up to the chinese hoteleries standards.............

I told them that their websites did not mention kids and adults, and they just mention 25 dollars per room for free breakfast. I paid a total of 50 $ extra to get breakfast included per night. Why should I pay 50 dollars plus another 50 dollars for the kids, a total of 100$ a day to get breakfast? It was a ripoff. I called Expedia and they agree that the hotel is wrong.

No coffee machine in room or refrigerator. The overall experience was good. So much more interesting than a usual chain hotel. I would definitely consider returning unless I find another affordable historic hotel to experience. One thought for improvement would be to spruce up Tick Tock’s decor A little. Wouldn’t change it’s overall character but better furniture, a maybe mix in some of the historical character of The New Yorker without losing the open and easy atmosphere.

"I have stayed at Wyndham Resorts on several occasions and believe that the New Yorker certainly falls short of the Wyndham standard and brand. 
 The property location is very good but is in desperate need of a complete refurbishment. The carpets are disgusting...paint work probably last done 20 years ago. The bathrooms are from the 60’s and the TV is a monitor. My rate without breakfast was $350 for 1 night. Don’t recommend this hotel at all.

It made this hotel more expensive per night than staying inside a Disney hotel. Also the parking fee is steep and it’s imposs to find a parking spot when returning from the parks at 12 midnight. The room is super outdated for the price. Customer assistance was mediocre.

"The property was exquisite. Well maintained. The lobby area was immaculate. Staff was friendly and very helpful. Definitely up to Disney standards. Only (2) complaints: 1). The cleaning staff needs to step up their game. Several times the daily garbage wasn’t emptied. Had to use another bag for trash. 
 2). The ice machine on my floor was down, not a big deal as I only had to go one floor up or down to get ice but there was no sign of any attempt on it being fixed, looked at, or notification that it’s bing worked on the week I was there and the exhaust fan in the bathroom wasn’t working and again no sign of it being looked at or notification for the whole week. Lastly the parking area needs to be addressed. I’m paying to park there and when I return at night there are no spaces available. How does one not have enough parking spaces per the number of rooms. Staff did offer valet parking to accommodate me but it still should be addressed. 
 But overall had a fantastic stay there.

"Do not valet your vehicle at this property!
 I made the mistake of allowing them to valet my mustang only to watch from my room on the 18th floor as two teenagers drove it around the parking lot at over 30 mph and then proceeded to sit in my car for over 5 min.
 When I confronted them they claimed they couldn’t speak English and didn’t know who it was that parked my car.
 Don’t trust them!!!!
 Also check in was way too long! Took over 20 min to check in and then they make you go to a separate counter where they high pressure you into taking a tour of their vacation club. It took us another 10 min to get away from them and get the key to our room finally. If you refuse to talk to them they will not give you a code for parking. 
 No parking in self parking at all! Very crowded.
 The pools were dirty and smelled of high chlorine levels. My daughters eyes were swollen and red after only 10 min of swimming.
 No water pressure in the bathroom. Tub leaked all night made multiple calls to have someone fix it so it would run all night nobody ever came.
 Housekeeping was knocking on the door at 9 am wanting to know when we were checking out even though we had the do not disturb on the door.
 Really I’ve stayed at most of the resorts in the area and this was the worst.
 I’m also sending a formal complaint to Disney because they are an official Disney hotel and shouldn’t be.

"Ich war großer Fax des Hotels und war bereits Gast in dem Hotel ABER! In den letzten Jahren hat sich nichts verändert. Die Bäder sind aus den 50iger Jahren und kaputt renoviert. Im Bad ist alles total abgeranzt und versifft was nicht an der Reinigungsleistung der Zimmermädchen liegt sondern weil bis auf ein bißchen Farbe , Jahrzehntelang nichts gemacht worden ist. Der Teppichboden im Zimmer ist auch total runtergerockt und noch der gleiche wie schon 2009.In Deutschland findet man so eine Einrichtung bei irgendeiner Oma auf dem Land die in ihrem Haus ein Pension betreibt aber nicht in einem Großstadthotel das 250€ die Nacht kostet.
 Die größte Frechheit ist die Gebühr von 35$ pro Nacht für die Benutzung von Businesscenter , Gym und Internet....Ich habe nicht von den drei Sachen in Anspruch genommen und ich habe dies auch beim Check-In gesagt. Man hat diese Gebühr zu zahlen ob man die Sachen nutzt oder nicht.... Den Hals nicht vollbekommen können nehme ich das.
 Das Hauseigene Tik Tok Diner ist auch so eine Sache...Bei unserem letzten Besuch waren wir fast täglich zum Essen dort weil es zum einen Super Lecker war, aber es wurde das Konzept umgestellt .Die Burger (ab16$ und kleiner als Cheeseburger bei McDonalds) schmecken grottenschlecht und auch alle andere Gerichte sind nicht mehr gut sondern nur noch Teuer....Spaghetti Bolognese für 19$....Mir ist bewußt das New York /Manhattan sehr sehr teuer ist!

There was trash on a chair in our room and my husband found a cockroach. I think it was alive. In the lobby, the floors and chairs were visibly dirty. Hotel room doors were visibly dirty.

"The first thing we did not like was that the man who checked us in acted like we were his least favorite people even though we had never met and I greeted him normally. Secondly, he told us we had a second floor room and we had 5 pieces of luggage - one of them extremely heavy. I asked where the elevator was and he said there wasn't one. He showed us a map of where the room was and wished us a good night. We would never have found the room and we would have had to hump all those bags upstairs by ourselves if the van driver had not come and helped us. Big thumbs down to the desk clerk - he might have offered us a ground floor room. Secondly, there was no way to turn on a light in the room when we got there. No wall switches or card swipes - had to walk into a dark room and feel around for a light switch for the desk lamp. The shower head delivered a very weak stream of water and the shower curtain was broken on the shower head side of the tub, so water all over the floor. The only reason I gave the staff a good rating is because of the one guy, the van driver who was wearing a cap with the word ""Security"" on it, was nice and kind and helpful. We booked via Expedia and thought we were getting a room with a complimentary breakfast, as it advertises on-line. But if you book a discounted room, you don't get a free breakfast. No where did it state that during the booking process.

Cant get around the bed because of the desk at the end so have to throw luggage over the bed to get it to the other side of the room. You run into the desk everytime you need to get to the bathroom. Not sure how multiple adults are supposed to stay in such a small room. I had one adult and one teenager and we had no room. The pictures on the website of the rooms are NOT accurate at all false advertising! Not to mention the paper thin doors and walls. Every day you could hear staff loadly on thier walkie talkies. No insullation for the windows could hear streer traffic,sirens and construstion all day and night! The bathroom was horrible again so small you could barely turn around. Tub was stained, paint peeling everywhere, faucet piece falling off. No ventalation whatso ever in the bathroom so when you take a shower the condensation builds on the ceiling so when you get out your being constantly pelted with water. This place is nowhere near a 4 star hotel. Its 2 min! BUYER BEWARE!! If your ok staying at Motel 6's then you will be fine here. But if you expect more or even whats advertised on the website you will be disappointed.

"The check in process was incredibly fast and without hassle. We were scheduled to check in at 4pm, but our flight landed at 745am in Orlando. I spoke with the front desk about possibly holding my party's luggage, and they informed me my room was actually already ready to go. 
 
 The property itself is nice, and I enjoyed the pool area. The rooms were clean, but small. For the price I paid, this was more than sufficient enough for my stay. It's not the fanciest hotel, but I do think if you can get this room cheap enough, for being a Disney Hotel, it is worth the price and would stay back again.

HMMM Also when I asked about a car service the man at the desk told me to call down from the room in the morning to arrange it.During this conversation another person came to the desk and he did not look happy with his colleague AT ALL. He told me as long as I could tell him an exact time he could arrange it now,.He did do that.It just seemed like the one guy didn't want to do anything to help at all. Happy to do nothing and get his check.
 I will say the young ladies at the desk in the morning were very pleasant and helpful.
 Breakfast was above average and the waitstaff were very good as well.

Honestly, didnt get to experience the full service of the hotel since we were out and about and rarely in the room. The bed was big and comfy, but the decor and style seemed outdated. The only thing I would recommend is that there was no mini fridge or a microwave, just in case we had leftover food from outside or in there in-house restaurant. Other than that, it was a beautiful hotel and we would definitely come again

"The room was very clean which is most important. I think we stayed in an older section of the hotel though. The room was surprisingly sparse, no pictures on the walls. No microwave, which was very disappointing. The beds were very hard and made sleeping uncomfortable. The closet was extremely awkward to hang clothes in. The elevators were very small and seemed to have no air ventilation. The pool was very nice but the pool bar/restaurant was closed for some reason and there were many of us hoping to get some drinks and food. I also think its insane to charge people $20 + tax per night for parking on top of paying for the room and the added ""resort fees"". But to be positive, good location, very nice pool and a clean room.

"This was a terrible experience to me.
 First of all I booked my one night stay at this hotel since it was showing competitive prices at the Expedia website, fool of me to pick it just for 10 bucks difference, at the end when I arrived at the hotel I had a terrible surprise to pay, as the lobby assistant told me, a mandatory 25 dollars charge for resort usage fee and 20 dollars for self parking fee. For 45 dollars more I would have gone a totally better hotel than this. The building is old, it is an open type facility like a motel kinda thing, see pictures of the hotel before you book, and the worst part, the walls are so thing that you can hear everything from room to room, I went to sleep at 2 am from the noise being made either at the next room or the room on top of me. I called many times to the lobby and asked them to do something about it, but they didn't. Terrible experience, over priced and couldn't sleep at all. If you are traveling with children, or you want to sleep at night or to avoid any hidden nasty fees forget about this hotel.

"The location was okay but we had a huge issue with our AC and we checked in at 6:15 at night and immediately called to let them know our AC wasn't working, the room was 90 degrees. They sent a service man to assist and he said he reset it and it would take an hour but it would start cooling off. It did cool off for about 15mins and then it stopped working again. We kept calling to the front desk and they said someone would come up but then we would receive a call 15 mins later to make sure we were happy with the new AC. I would tell them no one has been back to the room and it still wasn't working so they would apologize and say we will add a ticket in. This happened 3 times before a different engineer came. He was absolutely amazing and he said he had already replaced 4 AC's that day. He worked on it for quite a while and then called the front desk to let them know they really needed to find us another room because this unit didn't work and he had already replaced 4 AC's today and he didn't have anymore left. They said they were full so he needed to try and figure something out. The poor guy literally went to the engineering shop and pieced together 4 different units to try in the room. After every one he would call the desk and say it was sweltering in our room and they needed to find us another room. However they kept claiming there was no other room. Magically after the 4th at 12:30pm a different room became available. 6 hours of sitting in a room that was 90 degrees.

"Super friendly staffs! And they are very knowledgeable about all transportations you can take to get about. Lovely pools from 7am to 11pm. Gym 24/7. Transparent about fees. 
 Because I had to leave very early in the morning, so check-out speed meant a lot -- their check-out is soooo fast and actually all I need to do was to leave the keys at room!
 Also the location is perfect - easy access to all attractions, and to very good food.
 I just love the room's A/C. A little bit old-fashioned, but easy to control. It feels cleaner than center-controlled A/C as well. 
 Only one thing not so great: wifi is kind of slow and unstable. But not a big deal...not everyone takes work to his/her vacation...I'm just an outlier.
 Moreover, they offered comeback discount! Valid for 6 months. Started to look forward to my next break....

Personeel is vriendelijk en servicegericht. Je moet inderdaad ter plekke nog resorttoeslag betalen van 37 dollar per nacht, maar dit wordt door Expedia wel heel netjes van tevoren aangegeven dus het was geen verrassing. Het zou handiger zijn als ze dit bedrag gewoon meenemen in het totaalbedrag dan zou je er niemand over horen. Enige minpunt vind ik dat je nog 5 dollar per bagagestuk moet betalen als je je bagage na uitchecken een paar uur wil laten staan. Zou wel netjes geweest zijn als dit dan ook onder de resorttoeslag zou vallen.

"This is the second time we've stayed at this property. We like the convenient location near I-Drive which is walkable. The one thing that we didn't care for on this visit was the lack of umbrellas at the pools. There were maybe 4 umbrellas total surrounding two pools. The first time we were here, there was an umbrella for ever four lounge chairs. This being summer and over 90 degrees on any given day, a little shade is necessary. It was so hot we couldn't stay at the pool for more than an hour as we had nowhere to retreat from the sun. Also, the pool towels were lacking as well. In two days we had to ask for the towels to be replenished and on Sunday the pool attendant said we would have to wait an hour for towels and that we should go back to our room and take our room towels to use that day. The lack of people at the pool would probably be an indication that the abscense of shade and towels was an issue for others as well. We come to Florida to spend time at the pool and to not be able to do what we love to do on vacation will certainly come into play when we schedule our next visit. Unless the umbrella situation changes, we will not stay here again.

"If they weren't touching and moving all of my and girlfriend's stuff, they didn't make the bed or anything like that at all, location is not that convient, when you book online it tells you only 180$ for security deposit but when you get there you get told it's 280$ bc apparently it's 70$ a night for deposit, then when you get to the room there's a paper that says 40$ a night so which should be 160$. So I highly recommend staying anywhere but here

"The property is fine but needs a bit of renovation. The pillows were too big and the shower head was too low. None of those are major issues.
 
 The main issue was check-in. We traveled with 3 other couples and all of them got their rooms around 3pm. We went to check in before them all and were told our room wasn’t ready by two different front desk clerks. So we had to get back in line and wait for a different front desk clerk who miraculously had our room ready.
 
 I understand check in is at 4 but find it annoying that people who booked and checked in after us were given their rooms before us.

When we got to the room, we thought the door wasnt working but soon realized you had to literally body slam the door to get inside which was funny the first few times but became a bit inconvenient. Check out was easy as well, once more super nice staff. 
 
 We had stayed only one night and moved to another hotel on disney property for convenience. We realized we left a blanket at the hotel, capled back the next day to ask about getting it back. No one knew where it was so they said they would call us back. It took two days to find it but eventually they did after a few phone calls and were very pleasant about the whole thing. We unfortunately already left orlando so they are shipping it to us. 
 
 Over all the property is a bit dated but functional and the staff really couldnt have been any nicer! Will be stay there again despite the minor events.

 The hotel is much better than what it looks like on the pictures, it has a stunning setting with a lagoon that runs around the hotel, 2 pools and out door jacuzzi. The rooms have been modified and are excellent for what you need whilst staying in Orlando.
 The staff are amazing Anyka on reception especially who assisted no end and made it possible to upgrade to a premium room due to being there celebrating my birthday and being a member of the armed forces as it happened to be memorial weekend at the time, and this just enhanced the experience from start to finish. Sarah who works in both bars again is excellent, friendly and taking the time to speak to customers and ensuring they are looked after at all times whether it be in the hotel bar or the restaurant bar, a friendly face goes no end when people go out of their way to look after guests.
 The room service was excellent and done to a high standard every day and were always polite and helpful if needed for fresh towels, water etc.
 I’ve seen some negative reviews for this hotel which I think are unjust, for the price of the rooms in the location that it is, is excellent value for money, so much so I decided to stay for an extra two days at the end of my trip.
 Top class hotel with top class service.

"The shower was so confusing with the 4 different knobs but once you figure it out its ok. You can’t tell which one is cold or hot because the water would perfectly warm and then you would get cold water all the sudden then hot, but it was ok for two nights. The cafe in the lobby could be better. My husband and I went up to get a cup of coffee and we just stood there. It was open. So we went across the st to Starbucks. The rooms are small, well ours was but that’s what you get in NYC. Especially since it was built in 1930 which is pretty cool!
 
 I loved how there is a gentlemen standing near the elevators and you have to show your room key so no one can wander the halls that isn’t staying at the hotel. Very very professional staff. Lobby very nice with a lot of seating to wait or rest. We were upgraded on our room. Right across the st from Madison Square Garden which is where we went. Overall, I would stay again for convenience, kind staff and nice rooms if you only have two people or 3 and the stay is 2-3 days. I don’t know it would have been ok. Wish they had a breakfast bar because the diner gets too busy. Thank you!

"The hotel location is central. However the service by staff at reception is really poor . They take their time to serve you n most of the time is short of staff n Super Long wait . When it rains , usually hotels provide umbrellas free of charge for hotel guest but this hotel charges US$25 as a deposit . We stayed at this hotel for 6nights n decided to join a 2day one night tour to Boston over the weekend n recheck into hotel again on Sunday for one more night before moving off to atlanta . We hv to leave our luggages with the concierge n the hotel charged us $10 per bag for depositing over the weekend . This is the first time I stayed at a hotel where keeping the bags aside has a charge.That really shock us . When we asked for a receipt, was told that they only accept cash n no receipt will be issued . 
 This will be the last they see us & I strongly do not recommend anyone who is on holiday to stay in this hotel . Confirm your happy holiday will be ruined.

Lobby staff (other than checkin/registration staff) not always friendly, realize they have to deal with tons of different tourists and guests which impacts always being positive. BUT...
 The Tick Tock restaurant was great. Very dissapointed at the most historical part of the hotel, the basement display of pictures and tesla. looks like a summer student put it together. The NYH is an icon and should also have a spot to sell hotel memorabilia. Wish I could have left with vintage posters, coasters,. Something. Overall a very positive experience.

There is one for each Disney park and Disney springs which leaves in the morning and afternoon and also collects you from afternoon onwards- it was really easy to use. On our stay our sink in our bathroom got blocked but it was fixed ASAP. On one occasion our room wasn’t serviced but once we spoke to the desk they apologised and ensured it was done the next day.

"This hotel were renovated a year ago and it is amazing what a renovation can do. We had a clean, quiet and comfortable room. It’s convenient and close to everything. We could walk to the convention center and Disneyland easily. They have many options of restaurants nearby and it is a few steps from Anaheim Garden Walk. The front desk people were very accommodating specially Micky. The subterranean garage offered extra security to our car (which we didn’t need to use at all) with gates that operate only with your room key. We wish we could stay longer. We highly recommend it.

"As an Australian family with two children (5&7yrs) on holiday in the US, visiting Disneyland & California Adventure Park for four days, we loved staying at Wyndham Garden Hotel. See our positive comments below:
 
 The hotel was close enough for a 7-8 minute direct walk to the outer security point of the parks, we visited either once or twice a day (with a break in afternoon), we did not feel unsafe and even after the 9pm World of Light show or 9:30pm fireworks, there were still lots of people/families walking back along with us
 
 The staff at the hotel were genuinely friendly, helpful, the rooms were clean, our kids loved the two outdoor pools (luke warm & warm temperature which was great!) during our break from the parks in the mid-afternoon and we looooved the latte coffees from the cafe in the lobby area!! (A big plus for parents each morning!) 
 
 A huge plus were the surrounding businesses:
 - Two supermarkets/pharmacies with everything you’d want, 30 second walk 
 - Blaze Pizza across the road, with good sized wood fired pizzas with sauce, cheese and two toppings (we went Hawaiian) for $9.99 enough for an adult and our two kids only just finished one between them, awesome pizzas, crusts, staff were busy but happy, a really good relaxing dine in after a long flight/day in the park, went there twice in four nights
 - The Panda Chinese Restaurant in the row of shops adjacent to the hotel, 30 second walk, with really good (really large) Sweet & Sour Chicken, large fried ri

 AC thermostat was broken so you either froze or sweat. There was a broken panel in the room with exposed wires, snd we were told that was normal.
 Amenities dont exist in this hotel as they dont even supply you with a rinse glass in the bathroom.

"I think calling it a resort is misleading. I associate resorts with lots of amenities, mostly golf, somewhat secluded. This is definitely near things--approximately two miles from Universal Studios amusement park, within walking distance of Icon Park. There was a pool. But think of it as a little more than an upmarket motel, and instead of the front door leading outside, it had a corridor and room service. Every room had a small balcony. Some rooms are definitely louder than others (if you didn't get a poolside room, you have the noise of Icon Park, the noise of the parking lot, or the noise of Universal Boulevard to look forward to. None of the buildings are particularly well marked-- if you tell me I'm in building 9, the building number itself is easily obscured, and the signs in the hallway might suggest that a room number beginning with 10 is in that building (it's not). No elevators, odd numbered rooms are on the top floor of a two story building, so pack lightly or ask for help getting your stuff to your room. Good wi-fi, ok television channel selections, and close to highway on/off ramps to get places. Resort fee included shuttle to Universal Studios-- but only twice in the mornings, and maybe 3 times approximately 8 hours later (the 2 mile walk back has sidewalks the entire way).

"The lobby is spacious and beautiful. The first room we were given was way too small. I requested a small ice box for my medication. When the staff tried to install the fridge, there was no room and no electrical plug. We tried to call the front desk, but they didn't answer. We went down to the lobby to request another room that would accommodate a small refridgerator. We were told that they were sold out and did not have any other rooms. So, I was forced to put my medication on ice, but that did not last all night. The next day, after 4:00pm, we were given another room that would accommodate a small fridge. Another problem with the room was the bathroom. It had a pedestal sink with a mirror above the sink and a 4 inch wide X 3 foot long glass shelf below it. There was nowhere to store any products. All toiletries had to be repacked daily. If you want a small fridge, coffee maker, etc. in your room, you have to pay a fee for each item. The security was very good, and the housekeeping staff were friendly and excellent.

"Ursprünglich gutes Angebot, später Ernüchterung
 
 Hotel in toller Lage. In die Jahre gekommen. Kein wirklich guter Service. 
 Schockiert waren wir, dass bei Abreise nich einmal fast 32$ PRO NACHT sogenannte „Facility Fee“ angefallen sind. Das stand bei der Buchung im Kleingedruckten. Damit war das Hotel auch nicht wirklich günstig. Rechnet man das ein, hätte es in der Umgebung günstigere Alternativen gegeben, ohne Zusatzgebühr. Wir würden das Hotel nicht weiter empfehlen.
 
 Die Lage ist wirklich gut. Direkt an der Penn Station. In der Umgebung gibt es schöne Restaurants zu angemessenen Preisen, z. B. das Chef Yu. Auch findet man schöne Bars teilweise mit Livemusik. 
 Die Subway Linien ACE sind direkt vor der Tür. Die 123 Linien einen Block entfernt. Man kommt schnell überall hin.
 
 Die Zimmer sind stark abgewohnt. Es ist grundsätzlich alles akzeptabel, aber nichts ist umfassend erneuert. Bei uns war die Toilette verstopft. Die Reparatur, war am Abend nicht erledigt, obwohl am Morgen gemeldet. Hätte der Zimmerservice auch merken müssen. Generell lief das Wasser extrem schlecht ab, eigentlich nicht akzeptabel. 
 Wir waren im 24. Stock. Die Assicht zur Straße war gut. Allerdings waren die Fenster dermaßen dreckig, dass der Ausblick nur getrübt möglich war. Die Gardinen waren wohl ewig nicht gereinigt. 
 Die Aussicht war ok. Die Betten waren gut, die Handtücher etc. waren sauber und reichlich. Die Dusche war gut, warmes Wasser und guter Wasserdruck.

I had to call the front desk to find out evertthing. other two times I complained because of stinky smell of the rooms but this time, there were bed bugs and me and my friend got bitten several areas within just one night there. I counted, more than 10 bites. And my friend also had same marks as I did. I didnt bother to inform this complain becuase I know the fact that this hotel wont be changed and I rather pay extra money and go to Marriot hotel across the street where they have comfortable beds, nice smell, clean rooms which what a decent hotel suppose to have and this hotel doesnt.

 Next day I went to ask for a toothbrush, and same case, the morning receptionist was alone but occupied doing something in the computer, I stand behind until she will notice me, but looked like I was invisble, until I aproached her and say good morning, may have a tooth brush please..
 I have worked in hotelsand this is not the trainning we get.

I tried calling the front desk and got a a auto busy signal. My fire/cabin monoxide device went off on 3 occasions, I called wake up service who sounded as he was sleeping to report it he said he would send security. 45 minutes later still no one came to investigate. When I called back again on the wake up prompt I got a very intense apology that she would send some one out but alarm stopped and I did not want to wait any longer for someone to come out with no eta, available.

We had issues with our keys and neighbors and the staff was so responsive and cordial everytime we had to reach out to them. Just beware that some of these promotional photos feature the lobby and rooms from the main building, but there's no guarantee that you WONT end up in the wings instead, with the slightly outdated units. They're still decent, but just manage your expectations until you actually get to the property. Plus, if you're just visiting and using your rooms to sleep, it's a great place to stay at

Valet parking, huge lobby with bar and shops, all elegant just what I wanted UNTIL you get your room you go to park and find it you in a shabby building like most inexpensive motels. Completely motel style and completely excluded from the elegance of the main building and hotel. Definitely look through all the pictures before booking, personally I don’t even think showed the motel style building or rooms. When I drove up they were even well hidden enough by walls and being lower then the main building it was a total shock when I found my room. NOT at all where I thought I was staying. Paper thin walls, stained ceiling, wet carpet. Don’t be fouled by the pictures.

Also there was no water pressure in the or hot water at 9:00am on my first morning there which made it further impossible to take a shower. It looks to have been a very lovely hotel at one time but it currently feels somewhat grimy and not very well kept.

"Disappointing stay all around. I’ve stayed at various hotels for a while & the way the trip started with having to park your vehicle in such an uncomfortable way made the start in a sour way. The fact that the parking for the guests was on the opposite side of the building because valet took the other side made it very disappointing. When I went to park my car the pass code wasn’t given so I had to drive upstairs & was almost involved in an accident due to the driver next to my vehicle almost hit my car due to the tight fit. Upon entering my hotel room the smoke alarm sensor was going off & I had to go downstairs & alert the staff this annoying situation I could go on & on but luckily my stay was only for two days & not longer. I will definitely not stay at this hotel again.

 I will strong recommend this hotel to everyone, and especially to a family of 6. We were six people and we fit great inside the room we booked. We didn’t have breakfast at hotel, so I cannot rate the breakfast/restaurant and the related service. There are so many places around to try for different breakfast/meals every day.

"Had a very pleasant stay. Have stayed before and like this hotel due to location, good security, and the restaurant attached. “Tick Tock” is 24/7 and does some really nice meals for those times when you just want to eat local for breakfast or any other time. I did not use bar or sports facilities. Internet was good and international phone calls are free as part of the additional resort charges. Staff were helpful and there is a good left luggage service for the day you leave. 5 dollars per bag and then you free to do a further explore. We left bags and then went to Central Park for a few hours until departure time. We had a room that was billed as 2 double beds. There was 3 of us and taking this room option over 2 separate rooms saved us about £1000 which is a big chunk of spending money. Only real downside was the mattress sagged towards the middle. I imagine the rooms are used as upgraded twins the majority of the time. This meant you gravitated to the centre. As a single it was fine, but struggled as a double. Shower, coffee making facilities, fridge and so on in the room were fine. Cleanliness very good. So apart from a slightly saggy mattress this hotel ticked all the boxes for us. Would recommend for any family group, or lads away weekend. Great Irish bar across street and round corner “Jack Doyles”, 35th....and Pig & Whistle on next street 36th. But there is no shortage of bars and restaurants anywhere in NY. The New Yorker on 8th Avenue however is an iconic hotel.

"The New Yorker Hotel is located in an ideal area in midtown Manhattan. The quality of the rooms very much depends on what floor you're on. My first room was not impressive at all with paint peeling of the walls in the bathroom. I requested a room change, which was granted, and the new room was a bit more modern, but had no storage for clothing. The worst part of my stay at The New Yorker Hotel was the non negotiable fee they charge you for wifi and phone. They charge, after taxes, almost $40 a night in addition to your regular bill. Other similar hotels charge similar fees, but give you food and entertainment vouchers that can help balance things out. There are definitely better options in the city, but in a pinch, this hotel does offer comfortable beds in a convenient location.

"Check in was a big fail - a sign of things to come. We had specifically booked a ""deluxe king room with balcony"" which in the expedia description specifies it has a bathtub/shower combination. First, the guy at reception tries to upsell us on an upgraded room that has no balcony but does have a set of bunk beds in the room - why on earth would a couple want to pay more to have less ie no balcony? and why would we want to pay more to have a set of bunk beds that we are not going to use?! When we got to our room and realised there was no bathtub (even though we had verified it with the receptionist) we called the guest services line and an unenthusiastic voice told us to come back down and tell reception. No 'sorry about that' or 'we will be glad to help you!'. The second receptionist guy basically said the expedia descriptor was false - they don't have any rooms like that - and blamed his reservation colleagues saying there was nothing he could do. And on it went... 
 This hotel nickel and dimes you for everything - even when things don't cost you money they cost you in stress and make it difficult for you to just enjoy and relax. For example, nice pool area but why do you treat hotel guests as towel-stealing criminals before they have even entered the pool?! You have to sign out your towels - number of towels, room and name - and god forbid you don't return one, they will hunt you down!!

"The hotel was well situated but there were a lot of hidden extra's - even after a 3 rooms and a 6 night stay in each they wanted USD30 to store bags for 60mins. Wifi was a joke although you are paying USD35 per day for the extras (no choice have to pay it)which included wi-fi and some free calls.
 Some if the rooms although the same price were much bigger than others - overall not bad but would not stay there again.

"I hated that check in was so late. You can't check in until 4pm which is late. And if you get to the hotel early you can have them hold your luggage for you until your room is ready but you have to pay $5.00 per bag for them to hold onto it. After spending almost $600.00 just for 1 night you would think they could hold your luggage for free. Was not impressed with this hotel at all. Would not recommend this place to anyone. Will not stay here again. Beds are also very uncomfortable.

"Hotellet har perfekt beliggenhet! Rett ved Pen Station Subway, som tar deg omtrent hvor du vil. Togstasjonen til Newark Airpost er også nærmeste nabo. Kort gangavstand til severdigheter som Empire State Building, Time Square, Broadway, Rockefeller Center, 5Av., Macy's mm. Hotellrommet var veldig lite. Men sånn jeg har forstått det, så er dette normalen i hele byen. Drar man på ferie for å oppdage byen, er ikke dette noe problem. Hyggelig betjening, rene rom hver dag. Standarden på rommet er noe eldre, men etter min mening var det noe av sjarmen. Litt vanskelig å finne riktig temperatur på dusjen dog. Ønsker man en hotellferie, der mye av tiden skal brukes på hotellet, ville jeg gått for noe annet.
 
 Både frokostdiner (Tick Tock) og restaurant på hotellet. Restauranten var god, men noget dyr, Dineren er også kurrant, selv om jeg anbefaler å gå rundt hjørnet til Stardust Diner, som var bedre og billigere.
 
 Alt i alt en god hotellopplevelse, som kan anbefales. (tips: spør om utsikt mot Empire State Building, det var et nydelig skue å våkne opp til hver morgen :)

"I stayed 4 nights in Orlando and of course wanted to book with Wyndham like always. But I was very disappointed with my stay this time sadly. The tv in our room was buzzing, the cable was out for a whole day, the sink in the bathroom was stuck on off for awhile. It was hard to turn on. The grout in the shower was gross and it never stayed cool in our room. I’m coming back in September for my bday like I always do and would like to still go there

In most hotels, carpet becomes a serious health hazzard because of mold. Parking can be difficult. They have a good warm breakfast, but the dishes are a little bland. Prices went up recently, which is why I didn't give them top rating.

"Our stay was for four days and the reception was welcoming and helpful.The room itself on the 24th floor was in the same style as the reception, art deco and was clean with a comfortable bed. The bathroom was adequate but slightly dated with a bath and shower but no plug. The shower was powerful but the water at peak times was not hot. The TV was excellent and an iron and hairdryer were in the room. No tea making facilities though although this could be rented.The attached restaurant is open 24 hrs which is useful and they provided (if slightly costly) snacks and beverages. The room was on the 24th floor and had a view of the empire state building but you do have to keep the curtains closed as light pollution upsets restful sleep. The location is excellent to get to the central attractions and shopping. Food locally is plentiful as are bars. Overall I think this hotel is great value for the money but would have liked tea/coffee making facilities included but that said a 4 out of 5 from me.

Besides those intangibles, it is exceedingly well-located for transportation and convenience to museums and theaters. Also, we always appreciate the Trattoria Bianca for tasty, unfussy meals. And it's probably one of the least costly hotels in midtown.

"Had to wait 1 1/2 hours for room to be ready. I purchased a room a month earlier at a different hotel and on a scale of 1-10, this room was a 4 at best. The other hotel was at least a 9 compared to it. Plus had to pay to park. I’ll never go back to that hotel. Although it was close to Disney Springs, I’d still rather drive a extra 10 minutes and stay somewhere else.

"Three night stay. The second and third mornings woke up with numerous bug bites, 12 to be exact. Not mosquito bites but looking at pictures on the internet, looked liked bed bug bites. At checkout, I complained to the person at the checkout desk who did not seem to care at all and basically blew me off and I asked to speak with the manager on duty. I showed him all the bites and he took pictures of my arms, legs, and neck. He took down my contact information and said he was going to check out the room and get back to me. He also looked at me like I was making this up!! That was Monday morning and it is now Thursday morning and I have not heard back from him. We have stayed at this hotel several times before because it is close to Disney Springs. In the future, I will look at other properties. Very disappointing and hard to believe I was treated this poorly. Nothing like ruining a Disney vacation with aggravating itching at the parks...

"We found the facilities offered by the Wyndham Bonnet Creek properties fantastic, from Lazy Rivers to Mini Golf to BBQ areas to Eateries. It was a great place to relax after a full on day at Disney World (just down the road) or Universal Parks (20min drive away). There are also a lot of planned activities around the complex but the Hotel dint really advise of any of this, we actually found out in the activities area of one of the other towers, im sure they would had advised us if we had asked at reception. A couple of downsides, laundry facilities, we stayed for 16 nights so needed to do some washing, the complex doesnt have a laundry so the only drop off service we could find was 20-25mins away, so all in all for drop off and pickup about 2hrs. House keeping also let the Hotel down, threee days in a row the kids bunk beds were not made up, couple of days where towels were not replaced, taken but not replaced, our daughters bed one night had not sheet, just a blanket. A lot of other small things but when you are paying a good amount of money you also expect them.

However, we had to change rooms for a night due to the A/C not working, and upon our return to our favorite room, the heating system broke down. We also experienced a strong cigarette smell through the vent twice...not the hotel's fault of course, but unpleasant. Staff is very attentive, courteous and kind. Not a very family-friendly hotel; but truly ideal for the business traveler or for families with older kids. We really enjoyed our stay in spite of a couple of issues!

I always bring Clorox wipes and wipe down all my surfaces myself. What I really didn’t like was there were 2 trays of old room service in the hall for our entire 3 day stay. There was one in front of the next door and the across the hall. I don’t get why house keeping didn’t pick up. I was worried it may attract pests. It’s good place to stay if you’re looking for a low rate and won’t be in your room except to sleep.

"The hotel is in a good location but is the rooms are very dated. The sheets and towels were dirty upon check in, the bed was extremely soft, the hair dryer was broken, and the shower faucet did not work well. Overall, this hotel should not be rated 4 stars and I don't understand how it is. The hallways smelled of cigarette smoke on each floor and there was a lot of garbage within the hallways. Our guests were worried that their rooms might have bedbugs and did not feel very safe as anyone could access the elevators.

"Room and beds were small but clean. Bathroom was small and fixtures obsolete. Hotel padded the one-night fee with a $34.08 ""Facility Fee,"" which had not been mentioned, and was after all state and local taxes and fees. Then there was additional sales tax on that! I assume such bill padding is somehow legal, but it's unethical. We used no ""facilities"" beyond the room, which was already fully paid for!

"The hotel was close to Times Square, Empire State building and just across the street from Penn Station .We were upgraded to the New Yorker suite on the 40th floor with a view of New York and Empire State building we also had a fridge with complimentary soft drinks,as we were celebrating our 25th Anniversary. The bathroom is small as are the beds but comfortable and cleaned each day.When we reported a blocked toilet it was fixed immediately.Check in was quick. The only thing we didnt like was the charge for Wi-Fi ,but apart from that we would definitely recommend this hotel although it may not be modern and up to date .We weren't in the room much as we came to see New York city.The Tick Tock Diner in the hotel served good food and we were especially looked after by Ned the Waiter.

Our neighbors were not overly loud and obnoxious but the walls were so thin I hear the man burp! Awful and unfortunate. Beautiful lobby and pool, but when you can't get adequate sleep thise things become void. We normally stay at the B Resort when we come up, but decided to try this because of the pool for the kids. We wouldn't stay here again.

"Negative - I choice this hotel and paid more to stay here because it had the valet parking that several others in the area did not have. There was another hotel with limited hotel parking that was less and we chose not to stay there because we know how the parking in NY can be. Yet, on the 2nd night we arrived back at 4AM from being out with my family and was told that the valet was full. This was absolutely ridiculous. My husband then had to park over two blocks away on the street. If we wanted street parking there were many other hotels that were less expensive where we could have stayed. What also makes matters worst is I called this hotel before book to confirm the valet parking and they did not mention that it's limited valet. 
 
 Positive - The front desk staff was pleasant, check was smooth, the room was pretty clean. I think they cold have paid a little more attention cleaning the bathroom but not significant enough to call housekeeping to come back. The area felt save and very close to the mall and restaurants within walking distant; the airports are about 17 mins from LGA and 22 mins to JFK. 
 
 The room was very small is especially to hold 2 queen sized beds and 4 adults. We stayed two night for my Dad's funeral so it wasn't too bad. The price was reasonable for the area but given that I was expecting valet and ended up parking on the street it was not work the $145/night stay.

"We chose this hotel due to it being a Wyndham and the reputation and previous stays at other locations. We had high expectations going into the stay but were severely disappointed. 
 
 We arrived at the hotel and were ignored by the front desk. When checking in, we asked for a king bed due to a long flight prior to our arrival and the front desk associate said no with an attitude. Instead, we were put in a bedroom the size of a linen closet. You could barely open the door to get into the room. Once inside, there was no room to walk or relax. The bathroom door opened right into the toilet leaving no space. The wall on the left side of the bed was also jutted out causing injury.

"So nothing was wrong with the property itself it was very luxurious and well kept. Cleanliness was also a plus. This staff however was very incompetent and rude. I couldn’t even pay a fee to check in early because the girl at the counter said she had to call a manager to see if any rooms are ready. Honestly I feel like she just didn’t want to deal with me or the 5 other people kept waiting because there was an elderly couple that checked in right before me & they got a room. Everyone else was forced to wait for 3pm. She didn’t call a manager. She was on her phone texting. And while she was checking in the elderly couple she answered her personal phone to chat. Talk about unprofessional! Same thing happened at check out. I only needed the room for a few hours to get some sleep so I didn’t even stay the whole night. I’m waiting at the counter for at least 5-10 minutes before someone assisted me now mind you there are 2 girls at the counter this time around and no line. I was the only one in the lobby! One was actually on the phone with a customer so she obviously couldn’t help me. Fine. The other one was texting on her phone & completely ignoring me! I was really unsatisfied with the staff. The one one that actually made me feel like a valued customer was the man that checked me in. Smiled when approached. Very attentive and checked me in a timely manner while explaining how to use the shower and about breakfast hours. You need to fire the 2 girls that are always on phone!

First day they woke us up early by continuously knocking until we opened the door. Second day they left tons of towels on the dressing table and third day our room wasn’t even made. The manager and front desk staff were excellent and genuinely apologized. The manager on duty personally attended to us until it was cleaned and even comped the resort fee for that day. Other than that, this property is excellent. Location, service, cleanliness, amenities are top notch.

Ridiculous. The girls working registration had no idea how to answer my questions about what the extra charges were for. I think her name was Monica.

"When we checked in at around 2:00am in the morning, the clerk gave us the key to a room with 2 queen-sized beds instead of the one we booked via Expedia - 2 beds plus 1 bunker bed. As soon as I found out the discrepancy I rushed to the front desk. At first the man was very haughty and told me they did not have the room type we ordered and paid for, even without an apology for this situation. So I request for a partial refund, he refused and said that we had booked room via Expedia, we should ask for refund or compensation from Expedia not the Hotel directly. I was cross and continued to explain to this guy that the bunker bed was what we had promised to our daughter and now my daughter was so frustrated up there. Maybe due to my persistence, he at last told me that there was only and the last such room as I had booked. Since the guest hadn’t showed up yet, he agreed to change us to that room. And at 3:00 we finally moved to the room with a bunker. But the experience we had undergone was so unhappy. I should say this is a really costly hotel but with unsatisfying customer services in synch with its charges. I think I deserve an apology. So I won’t recommend it.

If you enjoy a time travel experience where you are woken by the rattling pipes at 5am every time someone in a room around you uses the bathroom then you will love it. Probably best for those deep sleepers only. Definitely not New York's finest.

The room let in so much noise it was hard to sleep. We put the do not disturb sign out daily and we still had someone some in to our room while we were gone. Parking was good for most of the visit as long as you got back to the hotel early. Two nights we couldn’t find parking. I was upset because it’s something we had to pay extra for daily and I felt I should be able to park when having to pay. The front desk was helpful and said our daily parking fee could be used towards valet, so that made it a little easier to deal with not having a spot. Overall, it was a good deal and so nice to be able to walk to Disney springs.

The air-conditioner does not work, we have to call front desk to have the technician fixed it. The biggest issue is room service. We kept calling for extra towels, there was four of us and they would only give us two sets. Each time they would come over and bring two large towels only, no Small, no medium. The second day was the same thing, she literally just brought over to lifestyle, as I was explaining to her we need small and medium, she just turned around and left. She never came back

"The best thing about this hotel is the LOCATION. You can walk to disney springs which is great. However the room i was in was very small it had a fullsize not a queen bed, so my daughter and i were uncomfortable on that bed, it was a handicap accessible room so everything was low (sink, closet, shower, etc) it was also steps away from the pool which is great if you want to go to the pool, horrible if you want to sleep, it wAs very noisey. Overall i was dissapointed for a Wyndam hotel.

"Lobby looks gorgeous but the rooms were terrible-old and dingy on a side section of the hotel. Looks
 like a motel 6. Dirty and old. Lights kept flickering. A/c didn’t work right. Stains on the ceiling. Mold in the shower. Not what was expected at all! Online the pictures look like it’s a gorgeous resort. Did not meet expectations AT ALL! When my concerns were communicated to the staff they didn’t seem to care and just gave me a blank stare. NOT RECOMMENDED.

"I loved how I got an early check in with no extra charge, and Linda who checked me in was absolutely wonderful and was the highlight of my stay. I also love that the greeters open the doors for me. But I didn’t love anything else about the hotel. The room was small and dark and had no fan in the bathroom and there was a long hair on the back of the door and a smudge on the tub. No coffee?? Adolescent/college kids were super loud in the next room and the sound seemed to go right through the wall. Also hated how I had a $37 service fee for WiFi. I was aware I was going to be charged, but it’s false advertising the base price and just makes me distrust and hate the hotel from the get-go. I was glad to have a room in nyc for under $200 and the location was great. But I’m trying to forget this stay and would never recommend it.

"Flot lobby.
 Fantastisk placering og var min 2. gang på dette hotel
 MINUS: de forlanger 31$ pr. overnatning for brug af wifi, fitness - hvilket jeg finder fuldstændig vanvittigt. Vi brugte ikke fitness og er kun on-line kort om morgenen og måske lidt mere om aftenen.
 Vi kunne ikke vælge det fra.
 Derudover koblede de os af mulighed for wifi om morgenen på dagen for afrejse 3 timer inden vi tjekkede ud!!! Simpelthen for ringe service.
 Desuden tager de 5$ pr. kuffert/taske/pose som man ønsker opbevaret efter udtjekning og inden man skal rejse hjem. 
 En stor pengemaskine jeg finder helt urimelig.

"Olin tyttären kanssa viikon tässä hotellissa. Ihana, ystävällinen hotelli, jonka aulatiloissa silmä lepää. Kaikki toimi, tosin emme käyttäneet mitään hotellin palveluista. Yksi miinus oli, nimittäin äänieristys puuttui kokonaan. Kaikki vedenlaskeminen ja muut putkistoäänet kuuluivat kuin olisivat olleet samassa huoneessa. Silti, nukuimme hyvin nautimme kaupunkimaisemasta ja siististä huoneesta. Lakanoita ei onneksi vaihdettu joka päivä ja muutenkin vihreät arvot näkyivät esim. roskien lajittelussa. Jääkaapin puuttuminen/ ei aamupalaa, nostivat ruokaan menevät summat suht. korkeiksi. Kahviloita on ympäristössä kyllä hyvin.

We could hear other people laughing and talking and hacking. When someone is taking a shower you could hear the pipes loud and clear. If you're not picky and not a light sleeper, it's bearable.

"The entrance is surrounded by a homeless encampment. My room had blood all over the bathroom, torn carpet, chipped paint, water rings on the desk and night stand (not cleaned) and upon asking for a second room, I got one which had dirty sheets, blinds that wouldn’t close and the room faced another homeless encampment, I checked out and went to another hotel.

"We arrived at the front desk after a long trip into NYC. We were greeted with a smile and a very pleasant conversation from the clerk. We were quickly checked in and directed to our room. The room as small but comfortably laid out. We were on the 21 floor with a beautiful view of the city and its lights. The hotel is old so the corridors are winding and a bit challenging when you are tired. They are clearly marked but returning to the elevator was always an adventure. We had breakfast in the attached diner the next morning and were captivated by the decor, clocks and clever saying keep us smiling while waiting for our breakfast. I highly recommend the Lemon ricotta quinoa pancakes with blueberry sauce. TickTock Diner is a wonderful addition to the hotel.

"El hotel es bueno y está,muy bien ubicado. Las habitaciones son de tamaño aceptable y el baño esta muy bien. Lo cuestionable es la política de check in, en cuanto al horario. La hora,de admisión es 4:00PM, pero te ofrecen admitirte antes si pagas U$ 50 extra. Encuentro esto poco ético, toda vez que si tienen la habitación lista y tú estás allí, es claro que te la niegan para sacarte dinero. Entiendo que son reglas del hotel, pero debo decir que no me gustan.
 Por lo demás todo bien.

"Let me start by saying that the hotel it self was very nice. Check in was very easy the lobby was beautiful. When I got inside my room I noticed a weird smell. But we were so tired we slept right through it. The next morning we were picking up our stuff to leave and I went to go through a piece of paper in the garbage can that was under the table. I noticed the paper was floating, so I pulled the garbage can out and it was halfway full of some liquid which I soon found out was urine. It smelled horrible and when I went to pour it out in the toilet it was yellow. I can’t believe that whoever cleaned the room didn’t check the garbage can. I’m not big on complaining or leaving reviews but this was just unacceptable. When I checked out later that morning I told the lady at the front desk what happened and she wrote it down on a piece of paper. And continued my check out. I don’t think that was right at all, I’m highly disgusted at what happened

"Our family takes about a dozen staycations a year staying at various resorts. We felt that this resort didn’t have that many amentities for how big of a resort it was. We received a voicemail that we could go on a timeshare sales pitch and receive a two night stay for $99. Which didn’t feel great since we paid over $250 for a one night stay. Overall our experience was ok, we wouldn’t stay at this resort in the future.

After leaving I reported this disgusting condition to the hotel manager Nara. After giving her two days to investigate my complaint I called her again and she stated she had no time for my complaint and would offer me a 10% discount on a future reservation. One problem is there will never be a future reservation at this hotel for me. HOW INSULTING!

"In my opinion, it’s unacceptable for a hotel to not have your room ready at the 4pm check in time. I arrived at 3:55pm, had plans for my family to shower after traveling there and then leave at 5:30pm to get to an engagement at 6pm. I had to complain at 4:45pm and then only did I get a room. 
 
 Secondly, I called at 8am to speak to the concierge and ticket agent about theme park discount tickets for the next day. I specifically said we would be there for one day and wanted to visit one park. I asked if there were discounts to purchasing through the ticket agent at the hotel and the agent said yes, up to 50% discount, but only after I checked in. I said ok and waited to purchase my tickets and thereby waited to select fast pass options. Upon arrrival to the hotel, I found out there was no discount for one day tickets AND with the agents “convenience fee”, tickets were MORE expensive than me purchasing them myself online. I’d appreciate honesty from my morning phone call instead of duplicity. 
 
 On a bright note, the room was clean. Because of the above two experiences, I would never stay there again. 4pm check in should mean 4pm check in, especially after spending roughly $200+ for a room for the night.

"The property carries the name Wyndham but honestly it is a refurbished hotel, maybe motel. The room that I had was way below standard for the price that I was charged. I went for a business trip and so it was fine, but if I were to have been with my wife, this would have been very disappointing. There was or is outside of the hotel grounds a homeless encampment and again, this company is using the name Wyndham as a ploy (in my opinion). I do not think that I would stay there again, sorry.

One white woman was yelling at her 14 year old daughter to not swim in the deep end and calling her the ""N"" word. There is a homeless camp next to the parkinhg lot. The rooms on theat side had a ton of young people who were partying outside and looked to be dealing. There were people talking very loud outside at midnight and at 5 a.m. outside our rooms.

Then I didn't have enough time to go to my car and get everything to my room and so they let me use one of there luggage locks to keep my stuff safe and they watched my bag and delivered it to my room. The room was really clean, wifi was simple and easy to use. Pool was empty at 2am so it was great. The fitness center was updated with new equipment. I only was there from 8:30pm Wednesday until 9:45am Thursday. I wish I had more time there to stay but tight budget. Would stay there again in a heartbeat. Trying to book it again actually.

"Would not stay here again! Been to the Disney Springs area many times, but my favourite hotels were fully booked. Decided to give Wyndham a go for one night before flying home to the U.K... I was not put in the main tower of the hotel, and if I had been I’m sure my experience would have been different. I was given a room in one of the courtyard type buildings connected to the hotel, which look more like a motel. I was on the ground floor, facing the car park. It was very noisy well into the night, with cars pulling up outside my room until around 1.30am and some honking their horns. After finally getting to sleep, I was then awoken early by all the delivery trucks pulling into the car park. To top it off, room service were knocking on my door before 9am to see if I’d checked out so they could turn my room over. Certainly not a relaxing experience before a long haul flight home. Would not reccoment to anyone visiting the Disney area, there are much nicer hotels with more modern facilities - this hotel felt very run down in the courtyard area, can’t speak for tower rooms. The pool area also isn’t the best. Staff were all nice, shame about the hotel itself.

"The best part about this hotel is its location. The room was clean but lacking in basic amenities such as a coffee pot which they even have at cheap motels. The lobby is beautiful but when you get upstairs (at least on our floor 35) walls were dingey and everything looked run down. The charge you to hold your bags while waiting for an available room at check in also. We hit nyc pretty hard so rarely were in the room, good location clean bed but thats it.

My wife and I were going in and the entire area was covered in dirty towels and empty glasses and trash everywhere. Not to mention that both the jacuzzi and pool were yellow. The other issue was the parking bill they charged us for. It was an obvious hidden fee that we occurred on our last day there. It’s fine to charge but let us know ahead of time.

They did have food that they made fresh for you like,omelets, pancakes, and waffles and those were good but the price point was a bit high. Other than that it was great I would definitely come back.

The refridgerator was dirty and the mirrors had what looked like pimple juice splatter on them. We were disgusted! To top it off they offered to not charge me for the room but at check out i had to battle with the services director. I recieved a one night refund after being told my 2 night stay would be comped.

"The staff was limited and hard to find. The two working the front desk had poor customer service especially the bigger gentleman, he was down right rude. I was told they had a hot tub but it was out of order. I was also told there was continental breakfast yet the girl at the front desk just rudely point to the bar & grill in the parking lot. I went to the bar & grill and waited over 45 minutes to be seated and still was not told how the breakfast worked. They were very understaffed and had no (poor) customer service. When I was given a menu, I ask again how the continental breakfast worked and what was included. The man helping me just grabbed the menu and said “continental” and walked away. A little while later I received fruit which was surprisingly fresh and a hard pastry which looked and tasted a day old. My coffee cup was dirty and I was not acknowledged the rest of my visit.. not even a thank you etc on the way out.. (or on the way in) My room was fair. Bathroom was dirty, old and had rust stains from the bar in the shower... overall it was not a great place to stay. I will choose a different hotel next time I am in the area.

There are restaurants nearby and the bar in the lobby has deals for breakfast. It's also right across the street from a Walgreens and CVS. What really sets this hotel apart however is the Customer Service. Stacey and her staff really went out of the way to make us feel at home as well as helped resolve an important lost luggage issue with us after we had already left their hotel (our fault). We will definitely be staying here on future trips to Disneyland and I highly recommend this property.

Also, the day that we arrived, we were able to eat at the breakfast, and they still did have a wide variety of choices, then the next time that we ate there, which was a little earlier, there weren't as many choices, and we feel that we didn't really get our money's worth that day. The busing to and from the parks was very helpful, although it would be nice if they had busing every 15 minutes instead of every 30 minutes before park openings and after closings because the buses were extremely overcrowded.

"We loved the location of the property, so close to Disney springs! Fun evening entertainment at Disney springs. We were on a ground level floor (1040), super convenient to get to the lobby, Disney springs, smoking area was directly across from us which was convenient. The pool was so close too. Loved the pool! Perfect for our 5 year old. The room was an average size, liked that the bathroom had a sliding door so you could be quiet in the morning. Our room did have a small gap between the door and floor which I think let bugs in- or they were coming in the bathroom vents or drains. We didn’t notice them much in the bed area but the bathroom was terrible. It was disgusting actually. Beds were comfy and clean. The daily cleaning staff didn’t do great jobs, we felt like our beds got made and that was it. The hotel has a character breakfast a few days a week and that was great. Not busy at all, the restaurant staff were amazing. I would go back but inquire about the bugs (they were only small and didn’t bother us, the kind of flying insects that love showrrs and sinks).

"Perfect location if you want to stay “off site” but still super close! We walked to Disney Springs (5min walk) and we used the transportation to/from the parks. Honestly not too different from the D value resorts. Loved the lobby and the staff at the hotel. Easy check in/check out! Valet parking was great ($20 per night) *which is about what the on site hotels charge now anyway... great coffee shop in lobby for grab n go, restaurant on site if needed, and Disney Springs a short walk away. Pool was gorgeous. Rooms.... definitely showing their age! I’m very particular about cleanliness and I must admit the rooms are outdated but clean! 2 Double beds in our room, room service menu (didn’t use though) and decent sized room overall. (Tad larger than D value resort rooms)
 Overall, I would absolutely stay again... and again, I’m fussy. If you are seeking luxury or modern style, upgrade. If you are a family on a budget but still want all the “resort fun and feels” Whyndham is a great option!

Other than that, love how conveniently close it is to Disney springs and how friendly the staff is!

"We stayed here for 1 night before heading out of San Jose airport. The hotel offers a shuttle to and from the, 5 miles away, airport.
 Jordan helped us on our arrival and was fairly indifferent, bordering on rude. Upon our return to the San Jose Airport, we followed their instructions to call for a shuddle when we were ready - that was at 6:05pm. After about 30 minutes of waiting, we called the front desk who told us they’d call the driver to find out where he was. After another 10 minutes we called again and they said he was on his way. Long story short, he arrived at the airport at 7:02pm (in the hour we sat there waiting we saw all the other airport shuttles come by 3-4 times so I’d definitely recommend any other hotel). When we talked to the driver he told us he was on his lunch break. We talked to Jordan at the front desk about our frustration and he was short, rude, and seemed like he could really care less. When we asked why it took so long he said he didn’t know the driver was on his lunch break, I asked why he didn’t know and he said because he was also on break. I guess my frustration lies in the fact that every other business functions while employees are on breaks, but apparently this hotel shuts down while the employees take their breaks. The room was overpriced and for the price to leave your car overnight, you would hope they could get you a shuddle after a long day of travel in less than an hour. Definitely doesn’t deserve my money or yours.

"Stayed at this hotel for the location. Room was small but it's NYC so that was suspected. For the most part clean did see noticable mold in shower and visible dust/dirt in the vents. However had a nice time. Staff was friendly except for the Wyndham desk people who quickly reminded me of the people at all the tourist traps in the city trying to sucker you in for a deal that's not really a deal. Needed directions to the bathroom in the lobby after pre registration and the woman ignores my question while my son is getting ready to pee his pants and insteads tries to sell me tourist packages. Skip the free gift that is stated on tour room keep. It's not worth the hassle. After waiting and watching her struggle over her sales pitch, I got my NYer attitude on and walked away from her. Found the info desk and they were very helpful and got a key for the bathroom immediately. Felt safe and secure in the hotel at all times. They had an employee checking keys to make sure the right people are in the hotel. Strongly recommend the diner attached to the hotel. Quick food and friendly service. Perfect location for events at MSG. We were there for a Rangers game. Subway is right outside and just up a couple blocks is times square, around the corner is Macy's and a small jaunt is Rockefeller Center. Subway takes you right to World Trade Center and a 10 minute walk from there is Statue of Liberty. Good location to get around.

"ニューヨークには沢山ホテルのある中で、4つ星の中では値段も高かったのですが、お友達も泊まった事も有り、お掃除の面で一番良かったので此処にしました。ルーム内はちょっと狭いのですがセーフテイーボックスも有り、毎日ベットリメイクやタオルも変えてくれるので、お湯もいい感じに出ました。ちなみに21階でした。エレベーターも早いので、エレベーターに乗る前にホテルの人がカードキーチェックを入れエレベーターを使用することができるので安全です。建物はかなり古いので、あまり新しくはありませんが皆さん親切で、チェックインの時はクレジットカードでデポジット45＄を一泊につき先払い。チェックアウトはカードキーを渡すだけでチェックアウト出来ました。7日以内にデポジット代がカードに返金されると言うことです。
 そしてチャックアウトの日にスーツケースをロビーの奥に置くのに1つにつき5€でした。ホテルのロビーから、3つのレストランのアクセスができてtick tokはアメリカらしいパンケーキ食べれましたが、サービス料金が高めででも24時間なのか人が朝から晩まで居ます。ホテルのインフォメーションカウンター横には、コーヒーとマフィンなど甘いものが手軽に朝だけ買えるコーナーがあります。コーヒー2、6＄くらいでした。後反対側にはイタリアンレストランに、ticktok の下にはステーキハウス、かなり高いみたいですが、見に行くだけ行ってみてください。素敵なレストランです。ホテルを出て右に34th Penn station左にも別の入り口が有り地下鉄で、いろいろなとこにアクセスできます。反対側のマデイソンスクエアガーデンの所にも、電車の大きな駅もあり、周りには24時間営業のお店が有り、ファーストフードも沢山あって便利です。8th av から34th street 5th av に向かって沢山お店もありタイムススクエア迄も歩いて10分程度です。ミッドタウンはホテルが沢山ありますが高いクラスの方です値段枠。タクシーの運転手さんがちなみに、次回はハーレム、ブロンクスが安くていいホテルがあっていいと勧められました。昔に比べてかなり綺麗でお巡りさんも居て安全らしいです。空港ーホテル56＄フラット料金でホテルの前にもタークシー乗り場あります。日中移動は地下鉄が、タクシーは渋滞でかなりの金額になりますがあちこちで捕まります。とにかく地下鉄駅界隈最高でした！

I’ve never been to a hotel with such kind and friendly staff. Loved that they had water bottles in the room because we were pretty thirsty after a long drive. THAT BED! The bed was so incredibly comfortable and the pillows were amazingly soft! I wish I could have taken them home! The one thing this hotel could use is a free breakfast in the morning. This is one thing my family appreciates in a hotel. Overall great stay, amazing staff, room was beautiful!

The only reason I rated a 4 to some categories is because the red chair in the room appeared to have a wet butt print stain in it. Needles to say, we did not sit in it.

"When you walk in the lobby is very nice but once you get to your rooms it is completely different. Our room it looked clean but when we went into the bathroom the tub was dirty and then we took a shower the water won’t drain. We had to wait 15-20mins for the water to drain; once the water was completely drained the tub was disgusting! The walls are paper thing we could hear the people in the room next to us and also the loud music from the mangos night club across the street from our room. Staff was very nice and helpful but over all not the best experience at this hotel.

I was headed to a Disney theme park and had to postpone my arrival time to the park to wait for an available room. When I insisted, I was finally given a room next to the maintenance storage closet. The room was extremely dated, smelled musty and had stains on the ceiling and bathroom tile. I asked the front desk for another room and was adamantly told that there were no other available rooms. When I asked to speak to a supervisor or manager, I was told that they were indisposed and not available to speak to me. During the night I heard a couple having sex and it was very awkward and inappropriate. 
  Additionally, I was charged $20.00 for parking which was not disclosed at the time I booked the room.

But the floors of the room was very dirty and since we were traveling with our puppy, we couldn't let them do a proper cleaning to the room but the floor when we first got to the hotel was really dirty. The 2nd thing we didnt like was that my booking said break fast included but if you are booking a room for 3 in which includeds a child, it does not make sence that the hotel gives you one free breakfast passed that covers the meal of the 2 adult but not childs, making you pay $9 plus tax for the childs break fast. We dislike this very much. The 3rd thing we did not like was that on check out day, one lady (staff) that was checking the rooms knocked on out room at 8:00 am to remind us that check out time was at 11:00 am of that same day. We think that knocked was un necessary and very inconsiderate from their part to wake up someone that early just for a reminder like if we didnt know or like if we were passed our check out time. Very rude. Besides, those 3 points, our stayed at the hotel was placent.

There isn't an actual closet in the room so we were only able to hang what we were wearing the next day and basically lived out of our suitcases. That said, the staff was friendly and efficient--true to Disney form. Although we didn't use the pool, it looked lovely. Disney Springs is an easy walk and a great place for both kids and adults--a huge bonus for this location.

The reason I say this is that the shower was made that you could roll in, no step up or down, the floor was sunken down so the water would drain. Also when I asked the woman as I was leaving if this was the DELUXE room she stated, Oh you made this reservation through a 3rd party, I said yes, then she stated well you got the 2 bed room. I don't believe this was a deluxe room. The wall paper was starting to come off in the bathroom, very small room. Not a happy camper. Thank You

 Very noisy - could hear outside noise (like carts) and walls were not insulated properly for room-to-room chatter). Big issue regarding lack of a diet soft drink ( I can't have sugar based sodas ). There were non on a Friday night) Staff at desk suggested I could walk to 7-11 (about 2 blocks away) and get there. I suggested someone from the staff could go get some and they brushed me off. Just curious, I checked on Saturday night to see if they had stocked any (of course NO). Since they really don't care about guest needs - we checked out on Sunday - a day early and found another place. Standards not up to what I would expect from Wyndham. Will not stay there again when I am in the area.

 I hung around and noticed this was a ""method of operation "" on many guests. Then, their rooms would suddenly be ready.

"Location was good if you enjoy or don’t mind walking. I thought it was great because I love to walk and close to the Metro. Hotel is cute. The room was smaller than I expected but was fine. The bed Only has one thin comforter and no other blankets in room. I like to be warm when I sleep so I had to layer up to stay warm when I slept. Don’t like the heater on. My only other issue was that the sink stopper kept getting stuck and not allowing water to drain because of the cleaning people. Had to call maintenance each cleaning day to fix it. Still worth the stay for the price. I’d still recommend.

Found out there was a horror convention happening, so parking was almost impossible and trying to relax by the pool areas was a little awkward when you have Freddy Krueger wandering around. Lastly the walls were paper thin. I thought the people next door were in our bathroom with us because we could hear them clear as day. On the other hand, we were in close proximity to Wawa, which was the first time we went to one - that was nice.

"We flew to Orlando from Kansas to experience our first night of vacation a BIG disappointment. I booked a king size room online ahead of time and when I arrived was told that the king size rooms were all out and I would have to take a room with 2 double beds. After a polite discussion with the staff I was told for the smaller bed they would give us free breakfast in the morning. It is 10pm so we take the room. Get to the room in Bldg. 12 that is on the ground floor with sliding door facing the parking lot by a Wawa convenience store with people driving by continuously and people standing outside window drinking and being loud. Went back to front desk & told them I needed another room where we would feel safer, (now more upset about not getting my king bed I booked). Told they have no rooms, requested to speak with a Manager about the problems of not getting the King I booked and feeling unsafe in the lower floor room with my wife. The Manager is able to find us a room in Bldg. 6 that is still not a King but has 2 double beds on 2nd floor. The only good thing is doorman got a golf cart and took our luggage & escorted us to the other building. Now we are going upstairs to our room and there is a strong odor of marijuana outside. I have had nicer rooms at Motel 6. This is not what I would expect or have received from other Wyndham Hotels. This place is a major disappointment to us. Did not sleep well in double bed because we have a king size at home & that is what I booked.

Our initial room had a horrible smell like body odor. We did contact the front desk and they switched us rooms. Second room was better smell wise, and the bed was ok. Place just felt cheap and unclean though. Paint pealing on walls in bathroom, walls dirty and stained in places. Was loud, cars coming and going and TVs/neighbors could be easily heard through walls.

I also called and was told I could use a hotel discount card, which I pay for, being in the state’s tourism industry, and I spoke to several employees before arriving, when I arrived, was told I couldn’t use it and I had to do something when I booked, which is exactly why I called ahead. The property was nice but too big for me. The room was good. I did have a bug on the ceiling that was dead, I found out and was just stuck there. No one had bothered to clean it and get it down. There was also a hair in my shower, stuck to the wall, before I ever used it.

"The hotel was generally good. However, the clock in the room had not been set to daylight saving time, but the microwave was. The heating a air conditioning was difficult to work and didn't have any instructions. The TV reception was not very good. The picture would pause frequently, and there were no instructions on channels and their corresponding numbers. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant, so they send you across the parking lot to a bar and grill restaurant. The restaurant had reasonably good food, but the chairs were worn and needed replacing.

"It is the first time an hotel really does the check in at 3 PM which is very late. After traveling i needed to rest for an important interview. Finally at 3 pm they gave me a key to a room which temperature was outside temperature (40s), I tried everything with the heat system for 30 minutes and ended up giving up. At the front desk, the lady started telling me I’d have to wait for the service guy about 30 minutes (on Sunday...). I told her I had an interview and really needed to relax. It is the first time she looked at me in all our encounters (hallelujah), and finally agreed to change my room... 
 The rooms are absolutely not soundproof. So after all that business I had my neighbors having sex and then yelling at each other’s. 
 The elevators buttons were so dirty, you were getting sick by just looking at them. 
 I will not go back to that hotel.

We waited outside for over an hour, for a false alarm. No one with the hotel staff ever informed us it was safe to go back in. I approached the the lobby hesitantly and was told it had been safe to return for over 30 minutes. Why didnt the hotel inform us that it was safe to return, instead of having us wait outside in our pajamas for so long? To make matters worse another evacuation alarm went off at 8AM Thursday morning. I called the hotel staff as soon as we made it safely outside and was informed we didnt need to evacuate. Again, why wasnt this announced over the intercom????? Horrible stay, terrible rest.

"Overall a nice property. We had three rooms which were all booked on Expedia. We would have much rather been placed in the hotel part, but instead were placed in the motel area (doors open to outside). This is something I try to avoid with hotels. I’m wondering if it had anything to do with us using Expedia. We did like that you can walk next door to Disney Springs.

"Right from the beginning I felt guarded about the condition of the hotel. It had an unclean feel about it. The room didn’t make me feel any better. I had paid extra for what was called free breakfast. When we went to eat breakfast I asked the waiter about the free breakfast. He looked surprised and said he needed to check the list. He looked at the list and said my room was not on it. He finally relented when I showed him my email with free breakfast listed. He seated us the went to the kitchen. A few minutes later he brought each of us a few pieces of fruit and a danish. I asked if I could have oatmeal instead. He said this was all we got because it was a continental breakfast. I ate a few bites and left, telling myself I would never book another room with Wyndham Hotels.

The pool area looked very nice and well maintained, although we did not use the amenity.

Only two negatives i have are we called front desk to ask for a razor and they said housekeeping would deliver two for us.. A day later we still had no recieved them and didn’t for the duration of our stay. Also, on checkout day(which is 11 A.M) housekeeping knocked on our door at 8:50 wanting to clean our room, I barely made it to the door before she proceeded to enter her master room key to let herself in.. I opened the door to a confused look as to why we were still there and explained check out was not for 3 more hours. She seemed unbothered that she almost just walked into a room that had sleeping guests in it. She replied “oh ok” and proceeded on her way to the next room. No apology or excuse me. I felt that was very unprofessional for a resort of this type.

One was used it had a wet towel, open soap and it smelled as if someone had used the restroom. I couldn’t believe it. To make things worse none of the room phones worked so I had to walk all the way to the front office. Not to mention this place is infested with roaches. Save your money do not book here.

"Good location near Disney Springs. The room was more like a rundown roadside motel. Apparently there is a real hotel if you are in the main building but beware the garden is the motel like appendages to the real hotel.The shuttle to Disney took forever, and after wasting precious hours we ended up driving the next times. Housekeeping never visited our room. The front desk staff was friendly but apparently powerless to address any issues. I got a minor case of food poisoning at Joffrey's Cafe so my day at Magic Kingdom was rather uncomfortable. All in all I would recommend choosing a real Disney property or just save a lot of money and stay at a Motel 6, because that is about the quality of our room. Sadly we thought this was going to be a nice splurge vacation but it was very disappointing. Two thumbs down.

I’d suggest to everyone that they valet the car. Parking here is not fun or easy. Plus it cost the same amount ($20/day). Other than that, this was our 4th stay at this property and we will be coming back in August for Star Wars.

 Service was lacking- it took 40 minutes, and 3 phone calls for valet to deliver our bags to the room upon check in ( I should have self parked for the exact same cost and carried my bags). Had issues with check out, took forever. 
 I ordered two kids meals from room service and they were meh. 
 I’m not high maintenance and have realistic expectations. I wouldn’t stay here again.

"Nice place. We drove up from Cape Canaveral, while on the way we asked if we could get an early check-in (no prob-room was ready) so that was a breeze! Room was fine. The only major problem was I specifically chose this hotel because it showed there is a Jacuzzi. Well, the next day we head out early to the pool and the Jacuzzi was not working (no bubbles) and the other pool area closed off due to construction. So, we were NOT happy about this. We were really counting on this.

"Room was ok but dated and worn. You expect more from Wyndham. There is a $27 charge for resort locale in addition to the regular room rate which is already extended beyond the quoted rate by local taxing. The hotel tagged my card with a $50 charge for the $27 aforementioned fee. Had to make a phone call to get them to correct it. What a bunch of crap!

"Although the property outside was beautiful and the pool amenities were great- the hotel room qhich we paid over 200 dollars for ONE night was dated. The tellevision only had basic channels, the room could have been cleaner. Upon checking in they hit you with a 24 dollar fee per day for ""maintaining"" the room amd property. I believe that should be included in the already expensive price of thr room. My 200 dollar room ended up now being 250 for one night stay which was less than 24 hours in the building.

En in de buurt zitten heel veel eettentjes waar je kan ontbijten. Enige minpuntje was toen wij de laatste dag de koffers weg lieten zetten omdat we ‘s avonds gingen vliegen en 12.00 uur moesten uitchecken dat we € 5 per koffer en tas moesten betalen en dat loopt aardig op als je met je gezin bent, zelfs voor een klein tasje moest je € 5 betalen.

We kept the bathroom door closed to block the cold and sound to sleep comfortably, but then the bathroom felt like a country hick out house. You know out house as in a deep hole with a shack build over it out side in the cold. I know its Manhattan busy city but we were on the 26th floor and the window let alot of strert sounds bellow through..the rest of the hotel was nice.

"Positives: The beds were comfy and the room was clean. Front desk staff members were mostly friendly. Restaurant staff at Gatorville were great! 
 
 Negatives: The bathtub condition was terrible. Peeling in several places. There’s no way anyone who wanted to take a bath would have wanted to do so in this tub. There was mold on the shower head and a very rusted vent cover. Very thin walls. 
 
 Also, there’s a $24 or more “resort fee”. No reason for it in the first place, but while their main pool was totally shut down and under repair it was ridiculous that they tried to charge for that. I mentioned this at check in and was told they could take half off the fee. When we received our check out receipt they had not given us the discount. They did refund the half off they had previously told us we could have. Had we not asked and double checked it would not have happened. When my husband called and asked if we could have a late check out they said, “No, we need you to be out at 11:00.” When my husband responded, “Is there anyway you can do a little later than that?” The response was simply, “Nope.” No ”I’m sorry...” No explanation.

"We were disappointed in several aspects of our stay. First, we arrived several hours before check in and wanted to leave our luggage while we explored the city. We've done this several times at all other properties we've stayed in (In New York City, Chicago, etc). Here we were advised that we could leave our luggage in an open room off the lobby, but it would not be secure. They do not/can not tag and store luggage in a secure spot. While we were deciding what to do a hostess offered us coffee and directed us to the cream and sugar. We accepted the offer, poured a cup of coffee and shortly thereafter we were presented with a bill for nearly $8.00 for what we thought was complimentary coffee for guests. The room itself was clean and nice, no problems there. A sign on the door in the room says check out time was noon. As our flight didn't leave until 5pm we asked if there was any chance for late check out. We were advised that check out was 11am (although sign in room said noon???) and we would be charged $60 for late check out (again, they cannot securely store bags before or after check out). We decided to go for a bite to eat and when we returned at 10:20am our room keys had already been deactivated (which we didn't discover until we were at our room on the 14th floor). So in a nutshell not a terrible experience, just a lot of inconveniences. They really seem to want to soak every penny they can out of guests and have you there the bare minimum amount of time.

 最後にネガティブな点も少々。
 １．シャワールームのドアが存在しない、すなわち半分しか敷居がないので、シャワー使用時トイレの方にどうしてもお湯が飛び散ってしまう。
 ２．スリッパを置いていなかったのは残念。
 ３．デスクがあったのはありがたかったが、その頭上の照明の明るさがまるきり足りなくて、本などを読める環境ではない。

When dropping bags in the morning there was a long line that moved very slowly - not ideal when you are hoping to get an early start on your day. When we returned in the afternoon to claim our bags, the service was even worse. We were second in line and waited for 20 minutes and they had not even retrieved the previous customers bags. We were frustrated since we were trying to make a train home, I spoke to a front desk clerk about the issue. Fortunately, he was able to get our bags quickly.
 My complaint is - if you are offering a service that customers are paying for, you should have appropriate staff to service that area in a timely and efficient way

"Room was not ready until 4:30 ( check in is advertised at 4 pm) . I called approx. 10 times from 4 to 4pm to ask status of room and got a
 Busy signal all ten times . To make matters worse upon telling a front desk staff member of this when I finally arrived to check on room she was very dismissive - no apology .. not a care in the world Type attitude . Very dissapointing.. also not a big fan of the 20 dollar self parking fee which either I missed or was not advertised too loudly when you book. Very convenient to Disney springs so that’s a plus .

"I had booked a king room. I get there & they have some excuse why they didn’t have king room. They put me in a family room with smaller beds & bunkbeds. Just one night, cleaning up after a trade show. Amalya at the desk charged me $60 for checking out at 1 pm or 11 am. She doesn’t smile, treats you as if she’s doing me a favor. Plus she kept me waiting for 5 minutes doing who knows what on her computer. Hotel cannot come through on king bed but has to abide by random 2 hour late checkout. Makes me notice the problems with the room. It was actually fairly clean but shower tray built into wall to hold shampoo hits you when you stand in shower under rainfall. It’s uncomfortable. And they give you shampoo sufficient for one, crazy for a “family” room. Left a privacy sign on door during my extra 2 hours & sure enough, housekeeping entered my room. Apparently, Amalya, who said she’d let housekeeping know, never told her. I would’ve given them a 4 but for Amalya. It’s close to Javits but there are 3 more hotels 1 block away. Funny how one person can undo a good feeling about your stay.

"When I arrived, the room I was given wasn't the room type I had requested on Hotels.com. I went back down to the front desk and was then given the correct room type.
 
 The room was great overall. Excellent modern decor with bed, desk, bathroom, fridge. Lots of floor space (which is sometimes hard to tell from online photos). The shower was excellent but used a TON of water. The in-room thermostat worked great for being there in the winter. 
 
 I have one privacy complaint. Out the window is another hotel or apartment currently being furnished. Their staff were going into rooms that didn't have blinds. The blinds in my bathroom were a bit crumpled, so I felt a little, well, exposed. It also seemed weird to have Venetian blinds in the bathroom (including IN the shower). They may have been in the middle of getting new blinds.
 
 As for the morning: I had also assumed breakfast was part of my stay. The buffet was $20. That's expensive, but not unheard of. But the seating/dining expectations in the restaurant were unclear. It seemed like a self-seating restaurant, and the buffet was laid out for self-serve. When I asked the waitstaff, though, they assigned me a specific table and seemed slightly offended when I had gotten up to get my own coffee. With better signs I may have been a better customer.
 
 This was my first time in New York City. Had a blast and was thankful to stay at a hip hotel like Tryp.

The way it was portrayed in the site and the reality is different. The breakfast could be improved. You wait in line to serve yourself plus they could improve in quality food . The orange juice are not original, it is very cheap and they could have more choices in the breakfast. Very poor breakfast.

 La déco de la chambre est contemporaine même si assez basique. La propreté était exemplaire dans la chambre et la salle de bains, mon pyjama plié sur le lit, le désordre rangé : très agréable de se sentir un peu chez soi quand on rentré épuisé après une journée de marche dans NY...
 Le métro au bout de la rue est super pratique même si nous avons presque tout fait à pied (10 min jusqu'à Times Square ou Chelsea). Le petit-dej est correct, un peu cher pour la qualité proposée.

"Andra gången vi väljer att bo på The New Yorker och det gör vi pga av läget. För övrigt, väldigt lyhört, dålig isolering. Vi bode på 8:e våningen och horde allt som hände nere på gatan kl 04.00 och framåt. Otroligt slitet hotel, sunkiga heltäckningsmattor. Otroligt skitig matta på rummet. Under dörren till badrummet, ett lager av smuts. Väldigt hårda kuddar som gjorde det omöjligt att använda dom när man sov.
 Vid utcheckning så försökte hotellet ta ytterligare ca 2000kr (ca 200USD) extra för avgifter och skyllde på Expedia/Hotels.com. Jag vägrade att göra detta till mitt problem. Slutade med att jag betalade det pris jag fått bekräftat inkl skatter och avgifter + 10USD. Varför jag nu skulle betala det men för att bli kvitt problemet accepterade jag det.
 + till att hotellet tog detta utan större tjat, uppgraderad till 2-rummare med bäddsoffa vilket var bra med 4 I familjen men att kalla det på Executive floor är roligt med tanke på hur det är I Asien.

"This is our second stay. The hotel staff are lovely but have now been restricted by the New Management that took over about a month ago. No kettle or coffee making facilities in the room. That’s an extra $25 per night. No help with luggage, that’s another policy change & $5 per bag to store if you have a later flight. 
 On the positive side, location is great, rooms clean, and all 3 restaurants & bars are great. Beware also of the daily room taxes which are now over $30 per day. 
 If you are prepared for this then the Hotel is great. I did complain about the lack of help with the luggage & this was dealt with promptly by the Guest Service Manager. Thank you. We are a family of 4 that stayed for 2 weeks so had a lot of bags!
 I would like to thank the staff. Shame on the Management. We will not be staying again or recommending you.

"We got there a day late, and they canceled our room because we hadn’t called in to notify them we were a day late. We had the room for two nights and only missed the first night. They then informed us that it was their “policy” that if we don’t notify them that we’re checking in the next day, they cancel the whole reservation. This policy is not on their website, and it is not in the booking or confirmation email that we received. We did finally get our room, but we did not particularly appreciate them canceling our room, making us wait for some time, telling us we should come back to check in at 3pm (even though we had the reservation the night before as well, and should have been able to check in whenever), and then lying to us about a policy that didn’t exist.

"This property is excellent for its location. It is across the street from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden and only a 5 minute walk from Empire State Building, Macy’s and Times Square. The Tick Tock diner is excellent for breakfast every morning and very popular. However, the price that you are quoted online before you go will not be the same price when you leave. As with a lot of U.S. hotels, there are local taxes and charges applied when booking out. There’s also a $29 charge a night facility fee. When I queried this, I was told it was for use of hotel facilities such as the gym, business Centre and WiFi. I have an issue with paying for facilities that I did not use. Also, when we were given the WiFi details, it pops up on your phone as ‘high speed FREE WiFi’. Obviously not. Also if you arrive before your check in time, expect to pay $5 per bag to put bags aside if you want to walk around while waiting to check in. I have stayed in the New Yorker many times in the last 10 years and I cannot fault it for its location and safety and security but there are a lot of hidden extras and charges when checking in and out.

I asked for one to make hot water and they wanted to charge $25 per night for a small tea making machine. 
 The heating makes the room very dry. 
 Only good thing about this hotel is the location but there are plenty other hotels in the area so I’d choose some other hotel nearby.

"We stayed here 3 years ago and had a wonderful time so rebooked for this year. What a difference. Our room would go days without being cleaned, and when it was done it was only half done, we were left at an amusement park with a toddler in intense heat because the hotel shuttle didn’t bother to collect us at the allocated time, they then tried to blame us before finally accepting responsibility but didn’t reimburse the cost of the taxi we had to get instead. food has decreased in quality and increased in price. We won’t be back.

I ran the Half Marathon and asked for a late checkout so I could shower before driving home. My husband was in the room and housekeeping tried to make up the room twice before 8am. He placed the Do Not Disturb in the door and came to pick me up after the race. Once we returned, the Do Not Disturb sign had blown off the door and in the hour and 1/2 we were still in the room, housekeeping tried 2 more times to make up the room. We felt very rushed and pressured to leave which was frustrating after a 13 mile run.

"Fantastisk god beliggenhed tæt ved 5. Avenue. Time square og generelt i god gåafstand til mange attraktioner. Metroen går 100 meter fra hotellet. Der er udmærket morgenmad uden at imponerer i forhold til dansk morgenmad standard Rigtig god kaffe. Der ligger flere morgenmads restauranter i gåafstand, men det er faktisk rarest at benytte sig af hotellets restaurant, da man går rigelig i forvejen til alt andet man ønsker at se. Personalet er super venlige, service mindede og imødekommende. Vi boede i Premium lejlighed som er pænt stor med 2 dobbelt senge. Men i det vi er 5 mennesker og der var en sofa som ikke var til opredning, måtte vi sove 3 i en seng. Det gik lige for os selvom det var lidt træls. 10 sal var fint. Ingen nævneværdig gade støj udover hvad der er normalt for en store by. Ligger op ad en police station, hvilket car uproblematisk. Stille gade af New York standard og alligevel så tæt ved alt. Hotellet er hyggeligt og det fungerer efter hensigten. Der er en roof top bar som ser hyggelig ud når den er åben. Vi var der i Februar. Fint motionscenter.

"Our stay here was generally a pleasant one. The king room we reserved was not available at check-in and we were given queen room for the first night, which, in addition to being much smaller, also had a broken closet door, leaking shower fixtures and a lingering smell of cigarette smoke, despite the property being advertised as smoke-free. Thankfully, when we spoke to Amalia at the front desk the next morning, she was very helpful and had us moved to the king room we had reserved. I very much appreciate her help and dedication to customer service.
 
 I cannot say the same for Orbitz. After speaking to two customer service reps, who offered me coupons for future stays but were not authorized to issue a refund, I spoke with a manager who explained there was nothing he could do, because Orbitz's terms of service permit them to give you a different, less expensive room than what you paid for, and there is nothing you can do about it. That right: I paid for a king room, they gave me a much smaller queen room, and then refused to refund the difference. The CSRs I spoke with at least tried to help; the manager clearly did not care whether I got what I paid the company for or not. I've been using Orbitz for over 10 years and have had mostly positive experiences, but they completely dropped the ball this time, and I'm not sure whether I will use them again. The measly amount of rewards I get compared to booking directly is not worth the hassle when something goes wrong.

"Great location. You really can’t beat it. You can easily walk to Disney Springs, and there were buses to the parks. This was the reason for our visit so it worked out well. 
 
 The room itself was dated and had a funny chemical smell like it may have previously been a smoking room a long time ago and the carpets had been cleaned many times to try to get the smell out. Beds were clean. Bathroom was not, the toilet was dirty when we arrived. 
 
 The pool area was fun, but difficult to access. It took us a while to figure out how to get out there because of lack of signs and it seamed like you had to go out a service area to get to the pool area. No grand entrance and just a little confusing. But once on the pool deck there were things for the kids to do and a nice big pool and hot tub. 
 
 The lobby area is nice and updated. There was a bar, breakfast and ice cram area. Staff was friendly and check in was fast and efficient, however the woman working at the desk that checked us in could not clearly explain in English how to get to our room and drew circles all over the hotel map, which also didn’t help. We found our room on our own following general signs, but she easily I could have said “pass the elevators and to your left, outside”. Again, just a little confusing for a first time guest.

You have to book this hotel know you will pay $ 50 extra for resort fee and parking. So if price sounds cheap...add $50. Still a good deal. Nice fluffy towels, excellent bedding. Try to ask for. Room facing the pool. Seems nicer there. We will stay here again.

"This isn’t a 3 star hotel- it’s a 2 star motel advertised as a disney resort hotel. Our room was not clean and outside of the actual hotel. Our room didn’t offer the amenities that a typical 3 star hotel would. Very deceiving

"The standard room is extremely small. We got a room that had a door connected to another room. We were able to hear their conversation clearly which would have made it difficult to rest. Thankfully, the hotel changed us to a room that was larger and quieter. Beds were comfortable and the new room was quiet, with the exception of the noise of the kids in the next room. Hot water was weird. It took a long time for the water to be hot.

"This is a motel is really a 1-2 star. It's very old and worn. I was very surprised that it's a Wyndham Garden and surprised that it was a motel (not a hotel). I felt mislead by Orbitz's rating of it. There is a free shuttle to the airport, which is about 10 minutes away. That's the best thing to say about it. 
 
 The negatives -- most of the hotel front desk staff were gruff and not very helpful. There's not free breakfast, which I would expect from this type of hotel. The room itself was old with peeling paint and cheap furniture. It is an old motel and there could be the potential for it to be really cool -- there's a little golf putting green and a pool -- but it's not be kept up or refurbished in a nice way. It feels like they're spending the least amount of money to keep it going! 
 
 I don't recommend staying here, especially for the price that they charge.

Once at the front desk I told them the situation & showed pics and the young woman called someone to fix the issue & said it would be taken care of right away. When we returned from dinner it was still dirty and it was late so I didn’t bother calling about it again. Also the room was a handicap room so no tub for my 5 year old and it was right next to the door opening to the hallway so it was very loud hearing people going in & out and opening & closing the main door all night. Minor things really but the dirty sink should have been taken care of.

"SV is a very expensive place for a hotel to operate I'm sure, so I want to be understanding. Staff was GREAT, and the room & bathroom were clean. My issue is that ""Wyndham"" is a name that (to me) is synonymous with a certain level of luxury, but this hotel is very dated and certainly not what I would consider luxurious. Unfortunately, staying somewhere 'newer' would come with a FAR higher price tag. That being said, the bed was comfortable and I slept like a stone. The shower head was in desperate need of replacement, but the towels were soft. It was fine...but I do expect more from anything bearing the Wyndham name. All things considered, sure, I'll likely stay here again....just with more realistic expectations.

The following day I was checked in efficiently, but the staff was not at all friendly. The room was nice and clean. The bar staff was horrible. Although they were not busy, we waited while the girl chatted, cleaned, ignoring our presence....finally, we called to her and she took our order. She was not personable or friendly and acted as if we were bothering her for requesting a drink. I asked for a Long Island Iced Tea. It was humorous watching her make it as she requested assistance from another staff member who finished making the drink. It was undrinkable. When I told her that something was amiss and I couldn't drink it, she said ""All the ingredients are in there"" and walked away! I was speechless. I told the other staff member, who appeared to be training her. He motioned to her to take my drink. I then asked for a Vodka Cranberry and no one ever made it for me until I asked a third time! A couple down the bar couldn't believe what they were seeing and neither could we! The ONLY staff that was friendly was Housekeeping. Although it's a good location, I will never stay there again.

Puddles everywhere. The hot tub was a slight green. Not sure why, could be the chemicals they use. But it was usable. Pool could definitely be warmer. The rooms are very cramped, the furniture they used is too big for the rooms. Unnecessary double desk you can't push in that takes up a ton of space. Bathrooms are super basic and old.

"Beware!! We stayed at the Wyndham for a work stay. The first night was just ok but i woke up with a horrible back issue. When i arose from the bed you could hear the springs pop. Left for work and put the Service room card on the door. When we returned we noticed that a spot that was on the sheets was there again. I also sleep with earplugs in my ears and when we noticed the spot i pulled back the sheets and found my earplugs in the bed which told me that the sheets were not changed. When i called down to the front desk, Jordan answered the phone. I asked if servicing the room and not changing the sheets was customary he asked if i wanted housekeeping to come up to change the sheets and i replied that i wanted to know why it wasnt done in the first place to which he replied ""i have no idea i dont work in housekeeping"" He was rude and snarky and in no way tried to calm the situation. Housekeeping came up and called the keeper from the a.m to tell her what happened at which time i told her i had pictures which killed the convo. Left us uneasy about how long sheets were on that bed and whether the towels were clean or just refolded from our previous days use. The next morning my back was worse but checked out with a $50 credit. The morning staff person was kind and apologetic but Jordan needs a different line of work. Hospitality is NOT for him! I won't be returning to this location. Room not work the rate.

"Loved having the convenience of Disney Springs right across the street. With that said I wasn’t a fan of the $20 parking fee or additional resort fees. The room was clean but we were right next to the dumpster and being awoken by the garbage truck in the am was no pick nick. The walls are paper thin and I could hear the conversations of both sides. So when my neighbor came in at 2am I heard retell all the evenings evebts. When my other neighbor woke up his kids at 7am, he also woke up mine 😖

Second night was not going to put up with it again so called the front desk 4 times before finally just after midnight it got quiet enough to sleep. Need to fix the door issue and maybe shouldn’t have a bunch of kids in the hotel without supervision.

"Rooms are nice however my family and I along with 3 other families were stuck in the elevator to get to the pool for over 1 hour. Front desk receptionists seemed to not no how to handle the situation and we ended up call 911 ourselves. After the doors opened another guest came up to me and said she reported the elevator not working at 6am Saturday morning, so why was there not a sign or anyone working on the elevator to make sure it was working properly. The general manager did what she thought was best for the families, but it doesn't change the fact our kids are still scared and the panic attacks that they had. It was hot hard to breath and my 10 year old even got a nose bleed. We stayed in this hotel last year for a soccer tournament so we chose this one again this year for a tournament as well. Not sure if this hotel will be our stay next year!

"The hotel is old and gross. The rooms smelled of warm pee, the pillow cases were dirty, the glazing on the tub was peeing, and there was a large crack between the window and the window pane making it both noisy and dirty. The picture of the renovated lobby is deceiving as the rooms are old and dirty. It might as well have been a Motel 6.

Operator told me I had to suffer thru the 10 minute recording in order to turn off the blinking light. I also did not like the resort fee that I was surprised with upon arrival where they charged me almost $30 per day on top of what I had prepaid. Apparently this is common in Orlando, however.

"Good location for access to shopping, restaurants and theaters, but very dingy, worn, old and tired appearing to not have been updated since first opening, so though perhaps clean, it appeared dirty. Staff was a little abrupt and cold, not giving a guest a warm and welcome feeling, more like we were an intrusion. I was told I was getting a room with a view, but view has to be taken with grain of salt as there was only a sliver of the city's skyline that could be seen from the room - better than nothing but I wouldn't characterize it as a room with a view. Other than that, I really enjoyed it's proximity to all that I wanted to see in NYC, and the cost did not break the bank.

When they finally got me into a room, they later tried to book another guest into the same room. This meant that as I was drifting off to sleep, a person with an active keycard was trying to get into my room. Thankfully, I had the deadbolt locked. All in all, this place felt mismanaged and uncared for.

The staff at the front desk, restaurants, and the concierge desk and hotel shop were all mediocre. Neither mean nor specifically nice- but I suppose it stood out because it certainly wasn’t 4 star hospitality and the staff at the various parks we visited were so much nicer. Overall, for being “on property”, if you get a good rate for this resort I’d say go for it. Just don’t expect a 4 star experience, it’s definitely a 3.

Staff at front desk apologized, but they didn't have the room I booked available and said, ""The person that checked you in didn't tell you?"" She spoke with manager and came back to ask if I wanted to have breakfast there the next morning. I informed them that I was leaving at 6 a.m. and she sent out the manager after a while. He seemed inconvenienced that I was unhappy for not getting the room I booked. He just kept shrugging and saying, ""We don't have the room you booked available."" He refunded my resort fee. Went back to room to get ready for bed to find something spilled down the side of the nightstand and hair in both the sink and tub. The tub had huge chunks peeling from it. The resort is more of a motel style with rooms facing the outside and the noise was significant. I was just glad I was only staying for a very short period. Will not stay or recommend this location.

The front desk staff seemed excellent at first, but it soon became clear they were manipulative and quick to pull the wool over your eyes with false “upgrades”. When encountering bed bugs, rather than refunding the night immediately they put us through a prolonged process requiring professionals to verify. Too bad they completely cleaned the room before the professionals came, thereby removing any evidence. After being fully charged it took us over a week to get the manager on the phone to sort out a refund. I’ve never encountered such terrible customer service. I had the chance to stay an extra night due to a flight cancellation and I did not take it. Additionally, male cleaning staff in the hallway made disgusting inappropriate remarks as we walked by. This made us feel very uncomfortable since he knew exactly what room we were staying in. Do not stay here.

"We had a great time. The hotel was close to springs so you can get to disney from there too. Was easy to get places, we used Lyft and I-Ride trolleys. The pool was so nice after a day of shopping.
 The staff were very nice and helpful.
 Would definitely stay again.
 I read the reviews before we booked, all I gotta say is you need to make your own opinion. My opinion is this was one of the best hotel stays yet.

The overall room was clean and the furniture and tv where in very good condition. The bathroom was clean and good working order. The mirror had slight damage in the top left hand corner but wasn’t broken. The rug probably could use some cleaning.

"Don’t go here. The rooms are super out dated and unclean. The lobby and outside look nice but when we got to our room it was awful. When we complained they offered two other rooms which were in the same condition which reflects the overall poor cleaning of the hotel. We wanted a refund so we could go somewhere else but the night manager Alex refused to accommodate us. He was not nice and was difficult to work with. Robert was really nice and tried helping us out but Alex wouldn’t allow it. Unfortunately we were forced to stay because they wouldn’t allow us to get a refund and leave. Worst last night in Cali. First and LAST time ever staying at a Wyndham hotel. Will not recommend to anyone.

"Great location.We had a few minor issues: we arrived to find a dirty sock on our bed, the housekeeper set our alarm twice to wake us up at 6am, the front desk sent us a wake-up call we didn't request on another morning, the heat didn't work very well either. One evening, we came back to find the windows open to our room and a barely working heater, so it took several hours to warm back up. Other than that, everything was fine.

"We were excited for a quick weekend trip to NYC this past weekend and excited for our stay at TRYP, based on the photos shown. Unfortunately, while the overall aesthetic was there, upon closer inspection the rooms were not nearly as clean and kept up as shown. Wallpaper was peeling, hair on bed sheets and pillows and overall the floors looked/felt dirty. I usually overlook little things, but when it comes to the cleanliness of the bathroom, that's where I get really picky. The floor tiles were moldy, the wall tiles were moldy, the soap/shampoo dispenser that had been broken off the wall was dirty and moldy...just not cool imo.
 
 The location of the property is excellent though, with a short 15-20 min walk to Times Square and right down the block from main subway lines. The staff was helpful as well, just wish the condition of the rooms were nicer and kept up. I was expecting a newly renovated room as shown, but got presented with a renovated room that needed a lot of love and cleaning.
 
 Not sure I'll stay here again, but will probably stay in this area of NYC again.

"My husband and I were very pleased with our stay at The New Yorker Jan 23-25 2019! Upon very early check in we were offered an upgrade for 2 queen beds with a large room layout for a small upgrade fee. The room was as described, very roomy and with 2 full baths a terrific plus! The bed was super comfy! I usually have a difficult time sleeping in places away from home and here...it was amazingly quiet and restful!
 The staff were accommodating, helpful and friendly and we would encourage anyone thinking about a stay here to make that reservation now!
 The best part were our meals at the 24 hour in-house restaurant, Tick Tock Diner! What an excellent addition to a great Hotel! The food was fast, hot and delicious and the waitstaff spectacular and friendly! Menu had great variety; feel good prices!
 Only disappointment....we did not get a chance to enjoy fine dining at Butcher and Banker...what a menu offering and the space is very elegant without being pretentious. Definitely next stay...as we will stay at The New Yorker every time we visit NYC!

The outside bar to the pool is not open on Thursday of our visit and we were there all day so was numerous other people. They also charge you $20 to valet park or to South Park which is ridiculous. My next trip I will stay somewhere else

"My daughter and I did a quick two day one night trip to Disney. We stayed on the sunrise side of the exterior rooms. I have no problem with that but there were only sheer curtains to the windows and no black out curtains to block the room. That made me very uncomfortable to stay in a room without the additional curtains with just the two of us there without my husband coming with. There was also a parking lot light that would shine into the room that I would say kept me from sleeping that night. There was only 1 body towel to use after showers, I had to use two almost three towels to dry off after my shower. The water to the shower did not get hot at all. Only the bathroom sink got hot water. I had to pay for parking while there is a small booklet that comes with the room keys that says to save $20 to not park at the theme park and to park at the hotel. The room is also dated. The location of the hotel is great with it being walking distance to Disney Springs.

They also claim to care about the environment, thus not changing the towels unless you put them on the floor. We always hung up our towels, but they were changed every day anyways. Also they individually wrap disposable cups in plastic, which seems as quite the overkill.

"Booked hotel for three days and two nights through Hotels.com for a staycation with my girlfriend. After checking in, the next day we found out the hotel charged us additional for the three days and two nights (they charged us for their nightly rates which is more than doubled than what we paid for on Hotels.com -- $600) when we have only been informed that they were just going to charge the security deposit ONLY. Spoke to the front desk in a polite, respectful manner in regards to it and no apology was issued -- just an ""Oh it looks like we did charge you extra. We'll just refund your card and you should receive it by the end of the week."" We spoke to another guest at the hotel as we were waiting in line and apparently, this happened to them as well (they were charged $900 extra). When we brought this up again to the front desk, one of the front desk clerk (a mid-aged asian lady) criticized us OUT LOUD to all the guest in the lobby that ""it's not even a lot of money. You should have more money than that on your credit card anyways.""

The room was a very utilitarian, generic ""motel"" room and not what one comes to expect at a hotel. The central A/C controls on the wall did not control the A/C despite the warning sticker on the controller. The room had an old fashion wall unit that sounded like a jet engine. The room was furnished with cheep particleboard covered with black veneer. Of course the room smelled a bit funky but that could have been the old air conditioning unit. 
 We were glad it was nothing more that a place to sleep at night.

My heater didn’t work and housekeeping didn’t clean one day because we left a few things on the bed. We actuator a letter stating that if we left anything on the bed they won’t clean the room.

"This hotel was built in 1929 and even though it has been updated (somewhat), much of it is the same as it was 90 years ago. Many of the rooms are so small, they're more like a cage. The bathrooms are so small, there is little to no room for a shaving kit. The toilet looks like the ones they probably have at Riker's. And because it's all original plumbing, it's nearly impossible to get the shower to a reasonable temperature. I suppose this is common in NYC, but next time, I'm not likely to stay there. By the way, the service was very good. Everyone was helpful. The facility is the only issue.

 The reservation included free breakfast.
 
 At checkin, the person behind the reception (Alex) was very unhelpful and wouldn't agree to arrange the extra bed. He told me to change to a double-queen room without adjusting the price. After arguing with him for 10-min, he said the sofa in the suite was a sofa-bed & sent someone to open it.
 
 The reservation included a free breakfast. Again the same person argued that my reservation didn't have it. He added it to the reservation only after I showed him my confirmation email.
 
 On the second day, the house-service didn't make the beds, change the towels or empty the trash. The reception just handed me the towels to take.
 
 Overall, the experience at the hotel was terrible & not worth the price paid.

He was rude and short with me for no reason, instead of trying to help me he sent me on my way so I can figure out what happened. Once I called the website and everything was figured out. He finished checking me, not once was he friendly. He didn’t even direct me to my room he had me look it up on the map. 
 
 The rest of the hotel staff we dealt with was great the room beautifull, just horrible experience checking in.

"The ratings are mixed because we originally reserved the ""garden"" section of the hotel. The rooms are cheaper there but we were not happy at all. The room was clean but there was space under the door, not access to an electrical outlet near the bed and old furniture. We asked to be moved to the main (""tower"") section of the hotel. It cost us an additional $50.00 per night but was so much better. If you stay here, avoid the garden section but be prepared to pay more. Nothing but good things to say about our stay after we were moved.

"Not that many hotel choices in this area of Queens. I booked for my elderly parents, who arrived around midnight. Front desk couldn't find my reservation at first, so my dad called me and eventually the employee found it. They were very courteous and apologized, but maybe not so organized? First room's toilet had low water pressure and was not flushing properly, and eventually my parents were moved to another room which thankfully worked. Rest of the stay was okay, and breakfast was good, but check-in could have been a much smoother process. Room is definitely small - but I don't know if that's typical of NY. King size bed is against the wall on one side, and small sitting area on the other side. View was great -- unobstructed view of Queens and Manhattan skyline.

The next room was very nice with an excellent view; staff were so helpful and understanding; but I am not sure if I will stay at this resort again.

Spoke to the concierge who could not have been more helpful - he gave us keys to two other rooms to see if either was more suitable. We took the room with a view of the Empire State Building and as a result of the extremely helpfulness of the concierge we had a great stay at the hotel.

"The property is in walking distance to Disney Springs. There are shuttles available to take you to the parks however we waited over an hour for one and had to go to Disney Springs to get back to the hotel. I was also under the impression that I would only have to pay 50 in resort fees once arriving at the hotel however that was not the case and I was never informed it would be a different amount by any of the staff members during check in or check out. Extremely upset that no one explained any of the extra fees. Unfortunately after the long wait experience for the shuttle and the extra charges on my credit card I will not stay again.

No hablaba español y nos cobraron 25 dólares de tasa de Resort que ya sabíamos pues lo ponía la reserva, pero además un 15% más de tasas que no venía reflejado en los documentos de la reserva. En cuanto a la limpieza un día llegué a las 22.00 h a la habitación y está no se había arreglado ni limpiado. Me descontarán 5.99 dólares por no haberlo hecho. Increíble en un hotel hoy en día.

Pet friendly, yes, but it will cost an extra 150.00. Which I never saw on the website. Maybe it was an oversite, but most hotels make it clear that it’s an extra 20-25.00 per night for a pet. This hotel had a resort fee and a parking fee. So with the low rate which I thought I acquired I ended up paying more then I bargained. I wouldn’t stay here again.

 The downfall was not knowing the exact cost of the parking fee before arriving. I knew I was going to pay but wasn’t quite prepared to pay $22/night to park. However, the parking garage is conveniently located, well-lit, spacious and the Wyndham offered luggage carts to help bring your bags to and from the hotel.

Courteous staff- always had genuine smiles and were ready to help. 4 blocks to Disney entrance- easy walk and totally worth it. We had relatives staying at hotels closer to Disney- they paid more for noisy, old rooms. We ate dinner at House of Blues located in the Garden Walk (open mall) next to this hotel- it had great atmosphere and service. My 7 year old enjoyed playing at Billy Beez (indoor play area) next to House of Blues. We ate breakfast at the IHop across from Disney- it was $86 for two kids meals, plain pancakes and a basic egg dish- no drinks! The next morning we ate at Mimi's Cafe just a couple more blocks down and it was great- affordable and yummy. You can get 4 of their amazing muffins to go for $8! When you enter Disney stay to the left- you will be tempted to go to the first line you see- don't. They all go to the same spot. Over ride your instincts and go to the lines all the way to the left. If you have a bag it will take you three times as long to get in due to extra security. Single rider is the way to go and the $10 add on virtual max pass is great! I even did single rider with my kids- saved us hours and they were sold after they got over the initial fear of being in a different car than me. I just made sure I went first so I was waiting when they got off.

I told them can I get another room. She said ok. I would figure an upgrade for the inconvenience or some kind of Complementary.. very bad customer service.. not a good way to treat your guest... your guest should not have to go through that coming from a 4star hotel.

"The property is dated and shows it’s age -and lack of upgrades over many years is evident from the moment you enter the lobby. The use of heavy coats of paint to cover faults does hide the grime.

"1) While we knew about them ahead of time resort fees are not appreciated. Most of all as they are considered ""Deceptive and unfair practices"" by the US Trade Commission as its basically a way to advertise cheaper prices then in our case double them. Anything with Official and Disney advertised as part of it should not allow this. Expedia should be more upfront about this, not small print.
 2) Hotel was clean and in good condition as was the pool.
 3) Counter staff forgot to authorize our parking pass and we almost got our car towed.
 4) They advertise two different rates for parking. One outside ($20) and another inside (counter staff told us $15). 
 5) We did not use valet parking but got charged tax on valet parking???
 6) Front desk failed to tell us about or give us the Extra Magic Hours pass we were entitled too. We heard about it through a 3rd party and had to ask for it with just two days left at the parks. 
 7) Rooms are not very noise proof.

 On arrival, the bed sheets were stained with blood and I reported it to the front desk and not even an apology in return. I needed it to call several times for them to clean the room and some days no show. So I ended up ordering towels that took forever to get on those days that room service was not done. To top it off I have to buy my own toiletries because they never refill it. I should be getting my money back this hotel was horrible. Enought that my husband and I ended up leaving earlier.

"Also von außen sieht das Hotel top aus. Das Zimmer allerdings, war ziemlich klein und die Möbel teilweise in einem unmöglichen Zustand! Die Schubladen gingen ständig von selbst wieder auf!
 Das allernervigste war, dass man jedesmal bevor man in den Aufzug steigen wollte, seine Zimmerkarte vorzeigen musste. Wir waren 9 Tage in dem Hotel und müsste 3 Mal täglich die Karte vorzeigen... Einmal haben wir es gewagt, uns 10 Minuten in der Hotellobby hinzusetzen. Sofort kam einer an und fragte uns ob wir Hotelgäste seien. Nachdem ich es bestätigte, wurde ich aufgefordert meine Karte zu zeigen. Wir haben uns gefühlt wie Schwerverbrecher...! Ich war schon in vielen Hotels auf der Welt, auch in viel besseren als das Wyndham z.B. Hilton. Und noch nie wurde ich so behandelt. Das war eine Frechheit!
 Noch schlimmer das dazugehörige Tic Toc Restaurant, wo man GEZWUNGEN wird täglich ein ordentliches Trinkgeld hinzulegen. War zweimal dort, das hat mir gereicht!

Floor trim boards are falling off, wall paper is coming off the wall, the vinyl on the chairs need be redone, carpets are are old. Had to change rooms because the handicap bathroom flooded due to not level floor. The rooms just look old. For $200.00 a night,... we'll stay some place else next time.

"Overall our stay was great. The room was spacious by NYC standards, and the bed super comfy. The WiFi was non-existent in my room, but I wasn't there to surf the web, so that wasn't too big a deal. I have only one real complaint: I arrived around 11 a.m. hoping to check in early if a room was available, but was told there would be a $50 early check-in fee! I don't know if this is common now or not - I've never come across it - but don't understand the logic. If you have rooms available, isn't it in the hotel's best interest to stagger check-ins so you don't have hundreds of people in your lobby trying to check-in right at 3 p.m.? I declined to pay this, and was able to store my bag for the afternoon. And the woman at the front desk did switch me to a double room without charging me, which I really appreciated. But still, that $50 fee seems like a bad idea.

"A nossa estadia foi em um quarto família, bem grande, com 2 camas Queen, 1 biliche e um sofá, 2 banheiros, uma copa com pia, cafeteira e pedimos um forno de microondas no qual fomos atendidos. Tivemos problemas com o ar central que não funcionou muito bem em toda a estadia e minha esposa e filhos passaram frio.Pedimos providências mas não foi solucionado. O quarto de casal poderia ser separado, mas não o é. A localização do hotel é perfeita, ao lado da estação Pen Station, Macy’s, Madison Square Garden. O café não é incluso na diária. O restaurante, terceirizado, tem pratos com preço honesto e de muito boa qualidade. Os funcionários da recepção, em sua maioria, são atenciosos. O hotel não disponibiliza nada em relação à talheres, pratos, copos, etc. Na minha avaliação é um ótimo 3 estrelas.

"Booked for a family weekend getaway to Disney World. Gave us a room on the 5th floor. Parking $20 per night. We got in about 8:30pm so after bringing luggage upstairs sent kids to get showers. Shower does not have hot water even though sink does. Took 7 tries to get registration to answer the phone and says no other rooms are available but will send up maintenance. Maintenance works for 24 minutes and gets water to slightly warm after water has been running for about 45 minutes. Go to parks early for magic hours and registration did not give the necessary “blue card” verification so we have to go to guest relations and end up missing magic hours. Never again.

"I booked this hotel 4 months prior to my stay booked a balcony with a view. I also called to make sure staff received the reservation and my request for a view of the lake, called again 3 days prior my stay to confirm my request and all was great according to the staff. I have a baby and we were anticipating the view of fireworks on New Year’s Eve from the balcony of the hotel. 
 Well to my surprise when we checked in we received the complete opposite of what we booked. Unhappy about the situation I agreed to wait for a different room. Waited 3 hrs, received a new room worse than the first. By then it was almost 9pm when we received the keys to the 3er room this one they called it an upgraded but off course still not what I asked for. We were so tired of waiting and frustrated we took the room, only to find a clogged toilet. I ended up dealing with it because by then it was new year. 
 The next day we checked out and moved to Disney property. 
 This hotel is nice but if you are going to spend this much money for a room stay at Disney you will not be disappointed. The food at this hotel is soo over priced $80 for cheese burger for 3 don’t do it! 
 Also very miss leading information and the view of fireworks is very disappointing. Parking cost more than Disney. Between the price for the night food and parking we spent at this hotel more than we actually spent in Disney with a dinnig plan included. After spending 40 nights traveling this year I can’t recommend this property.

 We also requested a late checkout before our reservation, while checking-in and the day we left. The hotel staff was not able to provide information on this, just kept telling us it was under availability even though the hotel is empty.

The interior of the guestrooms could benefit from some updating, also.

When we informed it was through Expedia she said, ""Oh, so 1st or 2nd level because we don't provide elevators"", she did not welcome us, she didn't even smile. She gave us the key cards and that was it. Then the doors in each room had to be shut so hard they would wake everyone up. Wouldn't stay there again.

Had to go to the front desk to ask for help with suitcases. Arrived to the room and no mini-fridge and none available. Terrible situation of trying to celebrate NYE, right?
 
 We made an organized pile of trash/bottles in the corner to be thrown, with a note asking to vacuum. Trash wasn’t thrown and no vacuum. 
 
 Water was questionably warm, two creamers provided, TV guide was confusing and wouldn’t give show names

"My family and I were in Orlando visiting family and enjoying nearby attractions and theme parks. After a long day out and about, we were hoping to pull into an easily accessible parking space near our hotel room. Unfortunately this was not the case. Each evening we returned to the property, we had to double park the car and carry our sleeping children inside. After which we then had to come back out and look for parking a few buildings down and walk back to our room. Wyndham Orlando Resort should allocate at least one parking space per room, clearly labeled and conveniently located.
 
 During our stay, the cable also went out for at least 2-days. While the staff acknowledged the matter was being looked into and confirmed technicians were on-site, nothing additional was done. No one was able to provide an ETA for when the services would be restored nor did the staff offer other ways for our family to keep ourselves entertained while in our rooms (e.g. portable DVD player, board games, arts & crafts).
 
 Last but not least, the housekeeping staff failed to replenish our towels on two occasions. The first time we let it go, and made due with what we had. However, on the 2nd incident we had to reach out and ask for towels to be delivered to the room.
 
 While the property itself was in a prime location for our purposes, we unfortunately will not be returning.

"We only stayed one night as we had an overnight layover. The staff and shuttle driver were friendly enough. My son really loved Monte. The hotel room itself was very run down. The chair was falling apart, the paint was peeling and the room smelled musky. I was afraid to touch anything and seriously considered finding another place to stay even though it was 1 in the morning. I did not feel comfortable or safe at all with my two small children (3 year old and 8 week old). I could not wait to leave that place in the morning and hope I didn’t pick up any bed bugs. This hotel is the type of place that drug deals go down in-at least it felt that way.

Had booked a rollaway bed direct with the hotel and arrived at 11pm to be told there were none left. After haggling for an hour they managed to find one and it took a further hour for it to be brought to the room. On 3 seperate occasions the room keys did not work and had to be reactivated. Ate in the tick tock diner 3 times waiting staff were lovely but on 2 seperare occasions got our food wrong. 
 This is definitely not a 4 star hotel but more lije a 2 star plus. Would definitely not stay again or recommend it.

"I really enjoyed the fact that this property was right in the heart of International Drive. However, the property is not what it seems. While staying there, the cable was out. When contacting the front desk, you have to call multiple times for someone to pick up. The property sits in the open, seeing as it is made up of multiple buildings. There is no elevator, so if you are on the second floor of the building, you must carry your bags up to two-theee flights of stairs. It is loud, the doors, rooms and property is outdated. Doors continuously slam all night, the walls are thin to the point where you can hear into your neighbors room. There is no security on the property so since the gates do not lock and are not controlled accessed, anyone can walk up to your room door. The front desk is not really as helpful and this property is extremely outdated, including the beds, furniture in the rooms as well as simple things like the blow dryers. I would not stay here.

 El aire acondicionado no funciona bien, hace mucho ruido y es imposible dormir.
 Lo reportamos pero nunca lo repararon.
 Se escucha todo de las habitaciones de al lado. Imposible descansar si en la habitación contigua están hablando.
 De 6 noches que hemos estado hasta el momento, en cuatro ocasiones no limpiaron la habitación. En las dos únicas oportunidades que lo hicieron, el suelo seguía sucio.
 Todos los días cuando llegamos de los parques llamamos para reportar que la habitación estaba sucia y no teníamos toallas; la respuesta es que lo sienten mucho y que la única forma de ayudarnos es enviarnos toallas.
 Muy mal servicio al cliente.

"The pictures on the website/ any hotels.com etc. platform are completely misleading. The room was over half the size of the photos, the bathroom was a quarter of the size advertised, the curtains were incredibly dusty, there was no fridge, no games console, no iPod dock as promised/ advertised. Daily housekeeping was dreadful, the same dirty pillow cases were just turned over every day, the duvets supplied were dirty, we were told we'd been ""upgraded"" to a King bed deluxe, which is even more alarming considering the size of the room was half that advertised of a Queen bed deluxe room. The room had a door leading to the next room in the room despite this apparently only being available ""if asked for"", you could hear everything the other guests were saying, even if a cough as the room is so small and walls are so thin the bed is right by the other guest's door. The waiter monitoring breakfast was incredibly rude and aggressive; especially if he feels you aren't going to tip him what he wants. The only good thing about the hotel was the location, but I'm sure you could get another hotel for the same price and the same distance to the main ""times square"", (probably can get one right by ""times square"") which actually gives you the value of the money you paid and service advertised/ entitled to for a 4.5* hotel. The doors in the room leading to the bathroom had chunks taken out of it, the bed also had chunks missing from the frame, it is NOT a luxury hotel.

"There was a radiator making noise all night and I couldn’t sleep. I also got in the shower only to discover that the shampoo dispensers had not been refilled so I had no toiletries to clean with. The hotel staff was not very nice and I found out I paid $400 a night for a hotel that is ordinarily $160 that just happened to be sold out on the two nights I was there. Overall terrible value for the money.

"it's pretty clean and all lools very new and modern. It's only about two blocks from Disneyland's main entrance. Well worth the 10-15 min walk. I can tell you I'm never staying at one of those across the street MOTELS from Disney; they charge for parking and a ""resort fee"". Wyndham on the other hand has none of those charges and is a much nicer hotel for about the same room rate. We'll be staying here on our next visit to the parks.

"Liked the location of the property. Close to Universal Studios parks, which was our reason for going to Orlando. Noticed on the first night out door wouldn’t lock unless the door was slammed shut. We let the front desk know and they said they would address it. This was a major concern since we would be in the parks and outside of the room the majority of the day and we wanted to be sure the cleaning staff was aware of the issue. We arrived back to our room and the door was unlocked. Just a push of the door and anyone could easily enter the room. We let the front desk know again and the issue was never resolved. Thankfully no one took anything from our room, but this is a major issue for people who are traveling with valuables.

"The lobby was located far from where our room was. So, if you needed microwave you would have to drive to lobby. The parking lot was connected to a gas station which was very busy and cars went extremely fast thru the at some times one lane parking lot. The bathroom had hair in the shower when we checked in. When we needed to get in touch with the lobby, we most of the time couldn't get thru to them. Our last night there our key wouldn't work to let us in the main hall. My husband called the lobby to tell them. We had to wait outside for approximately 20 minutes for them to come let us in. We were on second floor there are not elevators, which is challenging carrying luggage. The staff at check-in were very friendly and housekeeping staff were very nice.

"We waited 40 minutes in line to simply get checked in. I could totally understand this for it was Christmas eve. However, the rest of the evening unfold more surprises. Our room's door would not close unless you smash it. And it's hard to tell by looking. So we went dinner for a whole 2 hour, not knowing the door is actually open. The AC in our room is intentionally locked and could not be turned on until the mechanic came by. The fire alarm beeped all through the night for low battery. We called the front desk about it, but no one showed up that night. Above all, it is not a decent resort, but merely a motel locates at the side of a road.

"From the moment we walked in this was not what we expected. The lobby was dingy, old and dirty. There was not a sense of welcome felt at all. The check in service was horrible. The staff was rude, did not explain the hotel or facilities, did not explain additional fees. 
 Once we headed to the room as soon as the elevator doors opened we were more disappointed. There was peeling paint, dirty walls and carpet and a horrible smell. The room was even worse. The carpet did not feel clean, the walls were dingy, the bathroom was not clean. The mattress looked old and outdated. During our stay the hot water stopped working multiple times and required us to call several times. Only once did maintenance show up. 
 The lobby staff was not helpful, were always mad and very unfriendly. My daughter is on crutches and we asked to use the lobby restroom. There weas only an escalator and they did not have an accessible means to reach the restroom. The security staff was unhelpful and they thought we may be able to use the service elevator. 
 
 We spoke to the manager and he was very unhappy and did not seem to care about our concerns. This hotel was a bid disappointment. We expected more from a Wyndom and more for the price we paid

"Ok let’s just start by saying if you don’t book your room in the TOWER forget it!,,you will not be happy. I had no idea that they only remodeled the tower part of the hotel. The side rooms facing the parking lot is so old, dirty and bad it feels like you are staying at a cheap motel. After checking in at 3:00pm we went straight to Disney Springs walking- I came back at 11:00pm our shower didn’t work, the fridge was noisy. So went to the lobby complained they changed my room- we moved all of our luggage to the new room- guess what another horrible room- went back down to the lobby and by now 3 other guests were there complaining. Finally they put us in a let’s juat say decent room. 
 
 I only know about the tower rooms because we had a couple traveling with us that stayed in the tower. Amazing room- clean- big- quiet!!! 
 
 Ps. One side of the hotel is direct to parking lot ( OH YOU PAY EXTRA $15,00 per DAY FOR PARKING YOUR CAR!) the other side is the VALET PARKING they keep beeping the car horns to find them all day and night horrible!
 
 I only recomend this hotel if you book your room in the TOWER!!!!

 The upholstered furniture was badly stained with brown smears, as was the carpet. 
 
 The wheels of the chair at the desk were jammed so the chair was difficult to move.
 
 We stayed two nights and the towels and washcloths that we left in the bath for replacement after the first night, were removed but not replaced.
 
 The staff were pleasant and friendly. The associated restaurant (across the parking lot) is adequate, but nothing special.

When you drive out to find the building where your room is located be prepared to haul your luggage up a flight of stairs as the property does not have elevators to the second floor. The rooms are smaller than they appear online, outdated and cleanliness is poor at best. The balcony was dirty and the sitting area was stained and moldy.

"The hotel staff were really friendly. The Lobby was clean, as were the elevators and hallways. The room was clean but calling it a room seems a stretch. An oversized closet would be a more appropriate description. The entry door swing came within inches of the back of the room. Of all the places I've traveled I've never stayed in a closet. Even more annoying than the tiny room was the poorly hung shower curtain. The curtain rod was placed to the inside of the tubs edge. So not only are you in a shower about the size of a travel trailer but the curtain touches and sticks to you the entire time. The afternoon of our second day we returned to our closet around 5 only to find that the cleaning service had skipped us. Luckily the cleaning lady was just down the hall so getting fresh towels was easy but it was none the less disappointing. I didn't spend a fortune but I definitely paid more than enough to get a room, not closet and clean towels. Thank goodness I wasn't there to spend much time in the room. The area around the hotel has adequate options for food that are within walking distance. I stress walking because there's little to no parking around the hotel. The hotel offers parking, at $25 per night. I paid it one night but the space I was told to park in took me almost 20 minutes to work into. I felt like Austin Powers trying to get my vehicle turned into the spot. The next day I had to drive over the curb to exit because of the way other vehicles were parked around me.

There were very few options for lighting...one random light fixture was hanging from the ceiling over the bed (lopsided and not centered over the bed) and two recessed lights in the ceiling. That was it, no side table lamps, no reading lamps, nothing. There was wallpaper peeling off the wall, and the bed linens were sub-par.

"As someone who also works in customer service, it took one of the valet gentlemen to make our stay more hospitable. The front desk may need a refresher on social queues and communication. During my check-in and my return from picking up my fiance from the airport, the front desk was nor rude or friendly. Also, the room was very TIGHT. It's as if they tried to live a minimalist life. I understand we were there for one night but we were disappointed with the space. I don't intend on visiting here again nor do I advise anyone who actually wants to stay in their room to stay here. It is honestly good for somewhere to leave your things, shower, and sleep. The room was clean, they have outdated vending machines (it is 2018, why are we not using card machines??), and I felt like the rooms were secure to leave your belongings. PRO TIP: pay attention to the diagram taped down on top of the front desk; it is how you use the shower. Seriously.

"Really dissappointed with the charge for storing our bags for a few hours after check out on the day we flew out. We have stayed at many hotels from very high end to lower and have never been charged. What was really upsetting was that when we picked up the bags and paid the $10 pick up, our change out of $20 was given in $1 bills. When we asked for it to be in a bigger note, the bell hop rudely replied no bigger notes, we should just tip him. The bags were literally 5 steps away and all he did was bring them out and drop them. Seriously the service was so bad, he should have given us a tip. Cheers

"A vantagem é ter horas extras nos parques da Disney e ônibus na porta do Hotel. Porém os atendentes do hotel não são muito solícitos e quase ninguém lá fala espanhol, português ninguém fala, os quartos são pequenos e não tem microondas. Hotel tem academia, restaurante (tem café da manhã com personagens alguns dias da semana, porém muito caro). Não tem café da manhã grátis. Taxa de resort e estacionamento muito caros, porém o estacionamento oferece manobrista 24 há e são bem rápidos para pegar seu carro.
 Voltando aos ônibus, a Disney que disponibiliza, então na ida da pra ir sentado; Porém os últimos ônibus demoram e são lotados e geralmente para a area do lake Buena vista - Disney Springs você vai de pé ""justamente na volta"" :/ onde você está muito cansado - acho total descaso, não vejo esse transporte como algo grátis. Reclamei na recepção do hotel sobre os ônibus *a demora* e a disponibilidade para o hotel (eles mandaram eu ligar pra Disney e disseram que não tinham nada a ver com isso). Discordo! Deveriam informar a Disney a insatisfação do seu hospede e pedir mais ônibus para este hotel nos últimos horários. Até porque para os hotéis dentro do parque a disponibilidade é muito maior!!!! Dá pra ver isso! Vi um certo preconceito com os latinos, posso está enganada, mas senti isso!

"We liked how close the property is to Disney Springs and that you can take a shuttle to and from the parks. Although it is frustrating that the busses only come every 30 minutes. The snack bar was very overpriced, what I would expect for an amusement park, not a hotel. 
 Our room was so dirty with dead fruit flies everywhere, stains on the floor and a loud vent. The night we got there I requested A room upgrade and the staff was very rude and said call back tomorrow. We went to the park all day the next day so we were unable to get to the front desk and had decided to just deal with it and never stay there again. I know We reserved the base room, but normally the base rooms offered on Expedia have been great at other hotels. At checkout is when i overheard another unhappy woman asking for a new room, she was told that when you see “Garden” that means you are getting a basic room, on the first floor and I guess Not a clean room either.

"Great little boutique hotel in a very convenient location of NYC and across from a police station. 
 Easy to use all modes of NYC transportation, with the subway right at the corner. 
 Upgrading the guest towels would be an easy thing for the hotel to do... otherwise the towels feel like sandpaper. Soft close mechanisms on the doors would be a nice addition as it got really loud with guests not being mindful of the noise level that the doors make upon closing. Hot water can take some time to reach your room, but when it gets there its fine. Morning breakfast buffet was just ok and the lobby bar was actually nice and relaxing, making it a good place to rendezvous with other folks. There is good food very near by.

After a few hours from checking out from their hotel I called them to ask them about my beats headphone that I forget in my room and then they said that I need to call them back after 5 pm for the cleaning service to finish their work. At 5:30 I called them to ask them about my headphones and they took my phone number to check it out for me, and then they don't even bother to call me back!! I kept calling them that day to get an answer until one of the staff said we are still investigating we will call you tomorrow, and no one called me. The day after that I did the same and they also took my phone number, but no one called me at all. This is a bad and horrible service, and I still don't know if my headphone were stolen or just disregarded as a not important matter ?!

"The hotel is in a great location, literally across one bridge from Disney Springs and the foyer and main section of the hotel are beautifully decorated with great facilities, it's very welcoming! I was on a ground level room, and it does feel slightly 'motel' at first glance as the room was in a block and the car park was directly in front of it, however inside was a great standard, nicely furnished (a little dark of my own choice as I didn't want to open curtains onto the car park) and the shower was great. 
 
 Everyone I encountered working was friendly and happy to help, and the bus services to the parks were great and easily on par with the Disney service (which was one of my worries) as long as you don't mind visiting multiple parks on your way to the one you're going to (tip: if you want to go to Epcot, but missed that bus, get the Magic Kingdom one as it drops you at the monorail station for Epcot too, then get a bus to Disney Springs back later as you can walk from the stop to the hotel easily).
 
 For the price and location I was happy to overlook the room location, and if you're going to spend most of your time at the Parks you'll only really be there at night, so it's not as much of an issue as I first expected! I'd definitely consider staying again!

That is okay but they kid that went to pull out my car could hardly drive and almost hit a wall. On top of that they park your car either in front or in the adjacent garage so there really is no need for the valet. 
 Although the rooms were comfortable and reasonably clean, I noticed that they were not clean consistently. One day it was very noticeable that the floor had not been swept (they are not carpet so everything shows) and the bathroom sink had not been cleaned thoroughly. I noticed but it was not a giant deal to me and I was tired so I did not go down and report it. I probably should have.
 
 My trip was not for pleasure so the location was fine but, if you are coming to see NYC, I can see that the location might be a bit problematic.

"Check In experience was the worst of any hotel I have ever checked into period, and I stay in at least two hotels per month.
 
 I was very excited to stay here and was left bitterly disappointed by the hotel staff and policies for early check in.
 
 Check in is 3:00pm. I arrived at the hotel at 12:45 pm and asked of the possibility of checking in early, they said yes...for a fee of $50 USD. They went on say I could check in at 2:00 pm at no charge. So for 1hr 15mins they wanted to charge me $50 USD for a room that is already costing $390 USD per night! When I said no thank you to spending the extra money I asked what would happen to the room only to be told it would remain empty. Rather that give top class customer service to a potential repeat customer they chose instead to taint the experience to the point nor I or anyone in my family will every stay at Tryp again. I’m had a much better experience at the Even hotel which is located next door. 
 
 Terrible customer service.

 After seeing the dirty and unsafe room we paid extra and moved to the tower which offered a cleaner and safe room. I was perplexed to see the double standard between the two towers and the fact that they are irresponsible enough to even sacrify safety. I ended up paying far more that thw initial and quite honestly for the total ammount I spent, I would have stayed at the Hilton and I could have avoided the bad moment of the garden room. I will never go to that hotel again. Even the staff needs cuatomer service training.

"The best things about this hotel are location (easy walk to Penn Station) and staff, who are pleasant and accommodating. It can be helpful to have as it does a restaurant on the premises, as well. I have stayed here a few times due to location. For the price though, I think the very small room could have offered a coffee maker at least. I was able to get hot water for my bedtime tea at the restaurant but this was not convenient. Also no microwave or mini fridge. The pedestal sink made it a challenge for me to find a convenient place for toiletries though there was a shelf on the wall, designed perhaps for taller people than me. Perhaps small things to some, but they add up.

"First, I selected the option to pay upon arrival only to discover the payment was taken out right away. When we arrived I double checked with the front desk that everything was already paid and they verified it was. Nothing was mentioned at check in about the extra magic hours (which was the entire reason for selecting this hotel) and after calling the number for Disney they advised the front desk should have asked about the vouchers. I called from the phone in our room only to get the busy signal (tried for about 20-30 minutes). Upon check out I verified again that everything was taken care of and they assured me it was. No receipt offered. I checked my bank account again and found they deducted almost another $50 from my bank account only to be told by staff twice that everything was paid. When I called they said that was for parking, resort fees and tax. They would only refund the resort fee and taxes but not the parking in 7 to 10 days. Amazing they can take it out so quick but it takes awhile to get it back. Stay at an actual Disney resort next time it will be cheaper in the long run. The daily fee to park your car here is 15 per day.

"the hotel itself was nice, location was a little inconvenient for running to a store or going to a restaurant. I was disappointed that my prepaid cost didn't include $22 a night parking or $28 resort fee - another $50 a night wasn't included in my ""all paid"" in advance fee. Ordered Uber Eats and the hotel wouldn't allow them to park and bring the food up to our room when me and my 10 year old were sick with the flu. Also deeply disappointed that when I called the front desk at 1am to let them know my 10 year old was running 104 fever they wouldn't allow me to pay their NOT BUSY bellman to pick up childrens Tylenol. They would rather I drag an extremely sick child out in the middle of the night or leave her alone in the hotel room. Poor customer service in my opinion.

"My biggest issue with our stay was it was extremely difficult to sleep on Saturday night due to the party they were having in the hotel. We had woken up early for our drive and were super tired and just wanted to sleep, but it was difficult to drowned out the music, loud talking by people passing by our hotel room, and bright lighting. I am pretty low maintenance as far as my expectations for hotels, I mean I just want a clean and a safe place to rest. However, if I hadn’t been so tired I would have switched hotels, due to the lack of sleep we all got staying here. I was kind of surprised they would allow such a loud party with music to go on so late in their main facility being that rooms are so close to it. It was extremely frustrating to my teenage boys as well who needed to sleep because their volleyball tournament started again early on Sunday. We will not be staying here again, but I really hope they fix fire out a better way to block out noise and light if they are going to allow big parties in their facility in the evenings. Very disappointed with my stay here.

"I paid for 3 rooms. Lowest quality of cleanliness I have wver experienced in all my years of traveling. Bathrooms has urine or blood stain on tub side in 517 ..Smell was so foul coming from 505 bathroom. Staff member came in and said she would return and she didnt. Open shampoo and lotions containers in bathroom of 503 and wrapper from candy in window sill. Whoever worked the floor the night we stayed for housekeeping needs to be retrained.
 The front desk agent Kara was very helpful to making us move to another room as housekeeping was not available to clean the bathrooms.

"The Good:
 Friendly staff, especially the night front desk clerk
 Great location for Disneyland
 Freshly renovated property
 Fairly large rooms with good views
 The coffee shop prices are extremely reasonable
 
 The Bad:
 The coffee shop sells Seattle's Best
 The towel hook in my room was partially pulled out of the wall. 
 Elevators are pretty slow
 Limited parking
 
 The Ugly
 We did see a quite large roach in the hallway, although that could be due to the renovations
 There are some homeless floating around the parking lot, but they are harmless
 Road construction makes getting into the property a little challenging

"I’ve stayed at the property previously (2016) and had an amazing experience. I booked via Hotels.com and had a gorgeous room with a view of the grounds, a balcony, carpeted floors (not big on hardwood floors in hotel rooms) and a single bed. I arrived at the front desk and requested a single bed because I was expecting company but also don’t like to sleep in rooms alone with two beds; a qualm. The clerk gave pushback but ended up placing me in a subpar room to say the least, nothing like my first experience. I had a show the following day and some running around to do prior to so I wasn’t in the frame of mind for a lot of back and forth but this will be my last time booking this location. Most times when booking via the app hotels treat you like you came in off of the street and they’re giving you a room and you should be grateful for whatever accommodations they offer.

"When we arrived to the New Yorker it was quite a bit before check in and the staff was more than helpful and accommodating. We upgraded our room for a minimal fee and were quite satisfied with that decision. The room we were in had been recently renovated, had a good view and the hotel is close to Macy’s and Time Square. My biggest complaint is the bathroom. While pretty, it was always cold due to the tile and there was no counter space. That being said, I would definitely recommend staying at the New Yorker due to the overall experience.

"The lobby was beautiful. It looks like a gorgeous hotel from the lobby - when you go to your room it looks like a motel. Did not use the pool area but from viewing it - it really looks nice. Great customer service at check in.
 
 The reason for my visit was because my daughter is in the Disney College Program. Late Sunday I got a call that she was in the hospital after suffering multiple seizures. My flight arrived late Monday night & I went straight to the hospital. I called the hotel to let them know I would not be checking in that night. I had paid ahead of time for 4 nights. At check in they said they wouldn’t charge me for parking the first night since I wasn’t there. I didn’t expect to not be charged for the room for the first night since it was prepaid. 
 
 Complaints - the heat did not work in the room. I did not spend much time in the room, but when I did come back on the 2nd day it had only gone up to 66 degrees & housekeeping had not been to clean the room. I called the front desk to report the heat issue & housekeeping. Both did get fixed. I had to use the stairs - the elevator was broke the whole time. I had to leave at 4:00 am on Friday morning to catch my flight. I went to the front desk before I left & asked the gentlemen working if they could credit me for the resort fee for Monday since I didn’t stay there at all. I also told him about the heat, housekeeping & elevator. He plainly said There is nothing I can do you booked through Expedia take it up with them

"I am very unhappy having paid for 5 nights for a 4.5 star rated hotel and I was asked to move during the first night into a 3 star rated hotel. Which was not organised before my arrival and then the alternative accommodation was not the room size or bed occupancy I had paid for. One can appreciate having a child with you and having to go through this bad service is very challenging and inconvenient. I have always been catered to whilst waiting offered refreshments, entertainment for the child and due to the inconvenience given free room upgrades, neither were offered by TRYP.
 This holiday was a birthday surprise for my brother and to be honest the service we have received from TRYP had ruined our first day in NYC, not only was money lost but precious time also!!! Am still awaiting for management to acknowledge these issues and receive my refund!

"Initially enjoyed the experience. Problems appeared with the room late in the night as Inwas in the bar for a few hours prior and had only stopped to drop off my bags with my wife before heading down to enjoy martinis.
 
 When getting back upstairs I noticed it was pretty cold in the room. To correct this I turned on the heat a bit higher, as the night went on the room became colder, attempted to walk down to the lobby but saw it was empty for more than 5 min, went upstairs to figure it out on my own. Long story short, the room got to 58 degrees before someone allowed me to start the process of changing rooms around 2am. Originally the issue was that there wasn’t enough staff to help me, the person on the phone finally came up with enough complaining.
 
 I got to another room that was 78 degrees after being in a room that was almost 55 degrees. Once the staff member entered the room they were surprised it was in fact broken. My night and morning were spent dealing with this, preventing me from getting anything done, I ended up fighting the clock to get my work done before check out, when checking out, I tried to communicate my night to the staff member who was actively avoiding that convo as she never even asked how my night was. I ended. Up finishing my work in the lobby until my morning meeting.
 
 It’s a great hotel and the perfect location in relation to my clients. Also, rooms can’t all be perfect, just would have been nice for a much better communication and response.

"The location of this hotel was fabulous. Being right across the walk bridge to Disney Springs and then being able to use the Disney transportation options was The room wasn't anything to speak of (no pictures on the wall, very drab), but who stays in the room when you are in Disney? My only real complaint was check in. We arrived very early and I was certain the room would not be ready but the lady that checked us in said since check out was at 11:00 and we had arrived so early we would be the first to check in when a room was available. At 2:30 I checked back and was told we were second in line, but I had seen others checking in and receiving rooms. At 3:45 while standing in line again to see if a room was ready there were two other check ins, both with the same room I had reserved, and they were checked in immediately and given keys. When I explained this to the clerk, I immediately had a room. Of course, I was suppose to have received a phone call when the room was available (hours prior to this) and never received one. They need to improve the check in process if you ask me.

Then in the morning everyone passing the room with their luggage woke me up, only to be finished up with maintenance right outside my door. I asked to change rooms and was told that to go into a quieter room in the tower would cost $50 more per night. Finally moved to a higher floor which was better but not a good start for a Disney hotel with a resort fee!

I had to stand at the very back of the shower. A one position only shower. Thus, the floor got all wet. You need a shower head that can be positioned in different ways rather than stuck in one position. The sink was so small that when washing ones face the floor got all wet. The workout room was messy and lacking weights. The king size bed was v nice.

"Property is quite old. The lobby is very deceiving, The lobby has been updated. The rooms could use an update. 
 
 Pros:
 • Location, location, location. This property is pretty close to anything you need. The train, food, malls, & time square is not too far of a walk.
 • The diner stays open 24hrs. I got in way later than I had expected that due to some travel delays it was great to be able to get some food without having to leave the hotel.
 • The staff are all super nice and greet you with a smile.
 • Lots of options to eat and drink even within the building. So on those cold night no need to leave the building. (Steakhouse, Bar, Diner, & room service)
 
 Cons:
 • Rooms are small but that is not unusual for the properties in the city.
 • The TVs are older models that do not get many channels.
 • The beds yikes needs to be updated. The mattress we had the edges poked us so bad we jumped to avoid it each night.
 • You pay $30 a day resort services fee. It would be nice for the offered amenities were nice. They were average at best some subpar. The gym is ok. The business center is ok.
 • Price for what you get seems to be mismatched. Paid too much, for what you get. I would likely stay elsewhere next time. Since there are, other options are widely available.

 The best thing about this hotel is location. You can walk to times square, Rockefeller center, broadway... or hop on a train or subway next door at penn station. We used the subways to get everywhere, and got on and off 500ft away from the hotel entrance. Even the LIRR train from JFK airport stops right there.

The hotels christmas tree and general christmas decor is beautiful not OTT just lovely, they also have a little museum downstairs showing memorabilia and utensils, photos, posters etc from days of old at the New Yorker, well worth a look, a definate must stay from us, and would again.

Thinking it was a bottle of water it was instead an offer to listen to a sales pitch of one of their properties. But the offer was only for singles so I’d have to remove my wedding ring. I was traveling alone at the time. They also charge a resort fee which includes transportation to the parks. Coming back from the Magic Kingdom it took the bus 50 minutes to make a 2 mile trip. It just sits and waits and waits. I finally get off the bus to find crime scene tape covering the front of the hotel and a busted plate glass window.

 Ud og det beløb vi havde betalt hos hotels.com fik vi lige en ekstra regning da vi tjekkede ud af hotellet for hotelservice som mulighed for at benytte deres fitnessrum og wifi m.m. på 33 $ pr. dag (200 $ for 6 dag).
 Et ret stor beløb syntes jeg da vi jo kun var på hotellet når vi skulle sove 😏 og det var ikke noget men kunne fravælge.
 Men ud over det lå hotellet helt perfekt og centralt og personalet var meget flinke.
 P.s rigtig gode senge. 😊

"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. We had an amazing queen suite with its own balcony on the 30th Floor. The Hotel location is perfect, just enough away from times square, but a 10 minute walk. There is also a subway station right under the hotel, making it very easy to get anywhere quick. 
 
 Macys is just down the road, and a great Starbucks and Mcdonalds across the street. The hotel also has a diner ""Tick Tock"" for 24/7 food, which serves up really decent food.
 
 The room was spot on, really clean and well presented. Check in took no more than 5 minutes, and the security at the elevators gives you some comfort that not anyone can access the floors.
 
 WIFI ran at 10mbs up and down, which enabled us to keep in touch with work and do the occasional laptop activities. 
 
 We will 100% use this hotel again, you cannot fault our stay. The hotel look and feel gives that ""new york"" art deco (a little like ""hotel"" from AMS).

"Ww were happy with our stay. Our room was spacious and clean. They have several restaurant options (quite expensive though). We have stayed at Disney properties and this room was much bigger. The only complaint is the $22/day for parking, and the $28/day resort fee. Although I'm sure all hotels charge this in Orlando now. I do suggest that they put a sign on the gate after you check out to push valet button to open the gate as it was a bit confusing on what to do because when you put your ticket in the slot it says to insert credit card, but we already paid for the parking.

Even though we were inquired about valet parking earlier in the day the few parking spots were taken and we spent more than half hour looking for parking in the vicinity.. They should have told us about the parking problems when we arrived and we would have just secured valet parking earlier. The front desk ignored us at first and then basically said you are on your own - good luck! No offer to assist us where we could go and find street parking; we are Canadians so did not know the area and where to go - ended up parking 5 blocks away - just terrible. We could not sleep that night since it is NYC so enuff said. Will not book there again.

"Third time at the Wyndham, great hotel for what we wanted for our stay, but the resort charges and credit card holds are quite frankly off putting:
 Resort tax of $24 per day is quite frankly daylight robbery and merely covers the items that any hotel should cover anyway, we never had daily bottled water which in the tax.
 As for the credit card holds, the minute you check in they hold the amount of your stay straight away, plus they want another $40 a day security !!!!, apparently we should feel honoured that they only held one payment of $40 for our 7 day stay.
 I can only assume that the Wyndham Orlando has had a number of guests who have not settled bills historically, but treating every guest as a non paying risk is quite frankly insulting.
 My son still had a $400 hold on card three days after check out, he had to contact the reception at Wyndham Orlando from the UK by phone in order to resolve the matter, we had checked out with nothing to bill and no outstanding charges.
 Following this experience it will Air bnb for our next Florida trip.

I truly had no idea the rooms are outside access. Guess that’s what Garden means? They put us on the parking lot side but when I asked for a change to poolside (interior, quieter courtyard) they were able (luckily) to accommodate us. Rooms are nice. Front blind and curtain configuration strange. I am a person who notices small things like chipped paint, not keeping up appearances, etc. and there was some of that. Would I stay again? No, just because I don’t like outside access, it might not concern someone else though.

"Overpriced, not clean, noisy, old. This hotel was terrible. Paid $500 for one night. The room was the size of a closet. The rooms are very old so you can hear a ton of noise from outside the window and hallway. Worst part was that there was dark long hair all over the bathroom floor, walls, toilet, and shower. I'm pretty sure it wasn't cleaned and was disgusting. 2 of the restaurants on site were closed for private events. My key card stopped working when I went to the gym. I didn't have my wallet/ID on me so I had to wait for security come up to the room which took a half hour. I would stay anywhere else in the area.

"Decided to save money at Disney by staying in one area hotels listed on hotels.com for 89.00 per night instead booking at Caribbean Beach. So glad I did. For the amount of time spent in the room versus being at one of the parks it was well worth the savings.The amenities at the hotel were the same as those at Caribbean resorts, cleanliness of the room and location to the parks were accessible by free shuttle service same as well. The only complaint i has was that the cleaning service was knocking at my door at 9am to clean the room for an 11am checkout. Front desk was going to knock some money off my bill but it was already prepaid. I felt that I could have pushed the issue for another type of compensation but the rest of my stay didn't warrant the need to do so.

 Restaurant across the parking lot within walking distance. Coffee downstairs in the lobby in the mornings. The lady who checked me in rushed a lot and spoke really fast, but the lady who checked me out the next morning (Pamela) was very sweet and accommodating.

"Overall we had a decent stay. The hotel was a short walk to the light rail system which we used frequently. You have to go all the way around the hotel just to get to your room since there are no alternate access points but the rooms were lovely. There is a lot of storage space in these rooms, we had a flat screen tv (didnt get great reception) and a mini fridge. The staff at the front desk was very nice and informative but housekeeping could use some work. They were cleaning the room next to us and were very loud for it being that early in the morning. Talking to each other loudly and cellphone ringing plus that was a loud conversation also. I think they should remember that people are sleeping. Overall we had a great time in san jose! Thank you :)

Room was immaculate. We were on the 21st floor which is slightly dated but with the level of cleanliness we and grumble. The plug sockets were not great. Whatever you have plugged in keeps falling out so you have to be really careful! We were faced with a hidden facility charge and as a good will gesture the bill was halved as the facility charge includes everything we had no intention of using i.e conference room, gym, room telephone etc and unfortunately it is a mandatory fee.

Waited 20 mins to check in gave me the wrong key had to go back down. they place 100 holds on your card when you get there. The room was extremely small. the TV channels didn't work. Luckily I only had to stay there for a few hours due to a long layover.I wouldn't stay here anything more than 24hrs

"It was a clean and nice place to stay, but was frustrating because there are parking issues. We stayed on a Saturday evening, and since we were a late check-in, there were no parking spots available for us. 
 We notified the manager on duty, and he made a spot for us, and they helped carry our bags in. The service was great, but the whole parking thing was so frustrating for us, we probably won’t stay there again. 
 The hotel was clean and the beds comfortable, but the parking made for a frustrating trip.

The room wasn’t the most up-to-date, but it was clean and everything worked and we enjoyed some of the more vintage features.

"As the saying goes: Location, Location, Location! It was the initial draw of the hotel for us and it didn’t disappoint - the other amenities were gravy. 
 
 The New Yorker is located right near Penn station, making exploring the rest of Manhattan a breeze. 
 
 The room was quite small and a bit dated, but we didn’t go to NYC to spend a lot of time in our hotel room. It was clean and provided what was needed: a warm shower and a place to lay our heads after full days of walking and sightseeing. 
 
 The staff was friendly and accommodating. 
 
 There is a gym in the building equipped with elliptical, treadmills, stationary bikes, free weights, and various machines (shoulder press, chest press, lat pull down, quad extension, etc.). 
 
 If you’re planning on staying here, you should!

"We've been staying at the Wyndham, International Drive (previously the Marriott) for the last 25 years. Every time we've stayed we book the same type of room, a deluxe with resort views (it's called a resort so that should include all of the resort, including the gardens). Every time we've stayed we've been given a room with a balcony overlooking the gardens so booked the same type of room again this year. We only stayed overnight initially but are returning for five nights from this Sunday. Imagine our disappointment therefore, when enquiring if we could have our usual room when we return, we told that we had not paid for that type of room and we may not get a garden view as we always had in the past, without paying for an upgrade. As loyal customers to this hotel we are very very disappointed with what we have been told. Seems loyalty counts for nothing theses days. We are still hopeful they may give us our regular room but it has tarnished our opinion of them now.

"After I arrived at the location and checked into my room I received a knock on my room by the local police who stated that they had received a complaint about noise coming from my room. I ask the police officer who made the complaint and they said that someone called them and that we were to loud and that they didn't want to have to come back to my room again
 
 I was in shock when they mentioned that I was making noise late at night and that someone made a complaint.
 
 I didn't quite understand why they had been summons to come to my room when I only checked in 1 hour ago and spent most of that time unpacking and preparing for my business meeting for the next day.
 
 I asked the office who lodged such a complaint and when they arrived at the door did they detect any load disturbing noise
 
 They replied that someone complained and that they don't want to have to come back.
 
 After I assured them that they would not be coming back to my room for any reason they left and I returned inside the room (1265)
 
 I didn't know what to think of the encounter so I called the front desk and ask if there had been a complaint about me or my room and was the night attendant, who checked me in,aware of any complaint made that required the police. He said that he did not know of any incident that require police intervention in particular to my room. I asked if he could look into this for me and get back to me before I checked out in the morning he said ok he would look into it. So far nothing

"Our stay would’ve been nice but there were a few things that changed our mood. First, when we arrived to our it was hot and when we call front desk they acknowledged our issue and sent someone in. When the guy came to fix the air conditioner he seem rude towards us and thought we were lying about the temperature. Mind you he came into the room with a jacket and told us the room temperature was good and we disagreed since that is the reason we had him. He then made himself comfortable and stayed and we asked him if we needed him we would call the front desk and he chose to stay which made it uncomfortable for us since we just arrived and were tired. After a few minutes of us repeating the same thing he finally left. The next 2 days we had another issue with being locked out and then our rooms were not clean. We made the best of since we were tired but we were not happy with the outcome of each day at the hotel. I wish these issue had a different outcome. The location of the hotel is perfect. It literally has everything you need even the highway to the parks. Just wished it was a different outcome since this was a first family holiday getaway.

Hash brown, eggs, waffles and cold options like cereal too. Wish parking was included with stay! That was a little dissapointing considering how cold it was. We were told to park in the street, y husband parked legally in front of someone’s house (not driveway) and they drilled a screw to his tires. So maybe paying the $25 would save the inconvenience or risk of vehicle damage. Aside from that everything was standard.

As a silver member, I was able to book the room for even cheaper than advertised, which was great. When I went to check in, that's when the receptionist let me know that there is an additional $30+tax per night for resort use, wifi, gym, and maybe something else too. It's a mandatory charge, even if I don't use the facilities. That was a bit disappointing, as I don't think this was mentioned on the website. Regardless, the overall price per night was very fair given the location and hotel, but I just wish the extra charges would've been more clearly defined.

"Poor reception staff on arrival told the room was going to be small and old and we should up grade, which would obviously cost extra. It felt abit of a hard sell and not a great first impression. We decided not too the room was fine however the shower just a warm mist in the morning and cold mist by the evening. Extra daily charges were added on which were not really made clear by Expedia as we were focused on cost per room via website, then on checkout there seemed confusion about giving us back a resort , I will be keeping a close eye on my credit card ! Would not stay again.

"It was a little confusing when we drove onto the property. There was no parking on the street level, so we followed the sign for the underground garage. But once we got to the gate, saw we needed a room key to enter. So we backed up, and parked in handicap parking. I ran in to check-in. Thankfully the check-in process was quick. Once we got to the room, we noticed that the cabinet door that housed the mini fridge was broken. In the bathroom, the faucet was loose, and swiveled every time we turned the water on and off. Other than that, the overall stay was wonderful. Everyone especially enjoyed the rainfall shower head. Location was very convenient, as we were there to attend the Designer Con at the Anaheim Convention Center, which was only a short 10 minute walk from the hotel. Also, the when we first entered the room, it smelled really fresh and clean.

"The property and facilities were outstanding as were the staff. What I disliked was the shuttle service to and from Disney parks, more specifically the timings. The buses to the parks went at various times in the morning and the earliest return was 3:15pm from a specific park. If you miss the return shuttle the next is on average 1.5 - 3 hrs later. You could use the Disney busses from park to park in order to catch a bus but that is my dislike spending hours on busses during my “magical stay”. Next time I will stay in Disney resorts.

The art deco in the main lobby and the lobby itself is great. The rooms were the smallest I have ever had in NY. The water adjustment in the bath was impossible. Froze or scalded myself each bath. No amenities at all in the room. Plastic cups? Really. No coffee maker, no fridge. The Tick Tock restaurant on site was superb. Our floor (37) looked tired and old. Floor needs to be remodeled. Rooms are not accessible for most people. Too small and not sure they are even up to code.

"Lots of hidden fee's with this hotel, including a charge of $30 USD PER DAY for the facilities, whether or not you used the gym. This added up to an extra $200 USD during our trip that was essentially just thrown in the garbage from our perspective because we didn't use the gym once!

"This room was so bad I took pix of the room to show friends the deplorable conditions. The floor was dirty, the screen was ripped, discarded items were under the desk i. e. used plastic cup. It appeared as if someone had thrown coffee on a shade and didn't clean it. The desk chair appeared to be a garage sale purchase.
 
 When I complained to the front desk clerk she responded by saying, ""Welcome to Wyndham."" The manager Tai Vuong said he would send me a written apology. What a joke.

I was told the day before we could check in at 2 p.m. When we arrived, we we're told it would take another hour which was a slight problem with our planned schedule. Small things, like shower gel and shampoo dispensers in the shower were empty, could be improved upon. Room, facing the street with a lot of construction going on, could've been quieter.

And if it was, it was not obvious. When I asked at the hotel what it was for, I was told it was for Wifi and business and recreation facilities. First of all, the Wifi was billed as 'free' and second of all, we did not use any of the business or recreation facilities. Apparently this doesn't matter. It is charged to everyone, regardless.

"Se trata de un Hotel que en líneas generales recomendable, con el Madison muy cerca y no muy lejos de Empire, para acceder a Times Sqare se emplea 15/20 minutos a pie.
 Recepción hablan Español, las habitaciones están limpias si bien la mía disponía de un baño pequeño.
 LO PEOR; para trasladarnos al aeropuerto un conserje del hotel nos ofreció un servicio de transporte para 5 personas por un precio de 100 dólares, cuando llegamos al aeropuerto un taxi oficial nos cobro 55 euros, y dado que llovía en exceso y era muy complicado encontrar un taxi accedimos. Nos recogió un vehículo privado y nos llevo al aeropuerto y cuando llego la hora de pagar nos exige 120 dólares a lo que le respondemos que nos habían dicho 100 en el hotel, a lo que argumenta que había cogido la autopista , cosa incierta ya que nos es la primera vez que hacíamos ese trayecto y conocemos el paso por el control de la autopista, allí empieza un tira y afloja hasta que como siempre cedemos ANTE LA ESTAFA ya que se va el avión.
 
 Por tanto exijo al hotel que sea más serio a la hora de colaborar con taxistas sin escrúpulos que están solo para engañar al turista, eso si siempre y cuando el mismo hotel o personal de este no este en connivencia y ese exceso de pago realizado vaya directamente a sus bolsillos.
 
 Por último si llueve hay que salir del hotel al menos con horas de antelación para llegar al aeropuerto y tener tiempo suficiente.

No place to put suitcases so they were on the beds. Housekeeping did not come until we called twice. Someone finally cleaned room around 5:30 pm. The pillows felt like someone had stuffed them with socks as they were very lumpy and very small. Coffee machine in room never worked. Somehow in this day and age they managed to find a TV without HD so picture quality was very poor. Towels were so scratchy they felt like sandpaper. It was a hard rain one morning but of course the hotel did nothing to offer umbrellas for their guests to use. Never ate anything there - can only imagine the food would be subpar. I would suggest you stay elsewhere.

The drawers on the dresser would not stay closed....push them shut and within seconds they would slide open...all by themselves!! The bed was ok...hard and firm but tons of pillows. HUGE GAP under the door that lets a nice chilly breeze into the room. Tons of lights inside and outside of the room. If you need it to be dark to sleep then bring some sunglasses cause the window shades do not close all the way and the curtains are to short! I would not choose to stay at this place again for what i paid per night but it served its purpose and i survived. UBER picks up from here and was awesome.

"The room did not meet the expectations from the listing there was no coffee maker, though one was listed on the amenities. We asked for a coffee maker to be brought to our room after we checked in and by the end of our stay, none had arrived. We had to pay for our bags to be held after checkout, which in itself is ridiculous, and when we returned to retrieve them they told us what we paid was only half, the second half was required to take our bags. The bellman didn't accept credit card or allow us to charge the amount to our room. It was the end of our trip, and we weren't expecting to need more cash so we'd used our remainder to give our uber driver an excellent cash tip on the way back to the hotel. Had we known about the additional fee, we would have tipped using the app and saved the cash for this payment! Instead, we had to leave the hotel to go find an ATM, when we were already running late for the airport due to unexpected traffic delays. We had to go back into the storage unit to help the bellman find our bags because there was no organizational system! They were on an entirely different shelf from where he was looking! We wasted 45 minutes on this process when you consider that we had to wait in line for the bellman twice as he retrieved bags for other guests one at a time. We missed our flight by 3 minutes, as a result, which cost us hundreds of dollars! Additionally, the room was underwhelming. Only the lobby is luxurious, save your money.

"This is the 2nd time staying at the Wyndam and this time around although the room was good it had issues. The bathroom mirror light fixture was on the fritz and flickering constantly. the layout of the room was awkward with a cramped bathroom and lack of light in the long entryway. Check in was quick and easy, staff was courteous and friendly. Lobby/ hallways are sweltering while the elevator is way to cold. Might try somewhere else for our next trip but I do like this property and service.

Third room the TV remote didn't work properly, although we were able to work around it. When we tried to call front desk it went to busy each time - finally had to walk over to office to make complaint and they couldn't find any reason why the calls didn't go through. Office staff was helpful in trying to solve these issues and very friendly.

"From the outside and some yelp reviews we believed that this was a good hotel at reasonable rates. However, after making reservations and realizing that parking is an additional $25/night, the rooms are so poorly designed that two people cannot pass in front of the bed at the same time, the person who ends up in the bed next to the wall cannot even get into the bed from the side but rather has to crawl from the bottom. When we got there and two days after housekeeping cleaned the room, there was no soap for the shower, only a half roll of bathroom tissue, and no closet in the room. Also, there is a slab of marble jutting out where your head should be if you are planning on taking a bath. All this plus witnessing the argument while checking in between the desk clerk and an African American woman who was obviously not being treated right.
 There were several other major issues with this place and I will certainly NOT book another stay at any Wyndham hotel ever again!

Off made the room a furnace/unbeatable to sit in. Auto resulted in the air conditioner turning on and off all night. Everytime it turned on the sound jolted me awake. I got no sleep. A waste of money. Tried to get help from the front desk. They had no understanding and told me there was no solution. Very poor customer service.

 When we arrived the computers were down so we couldn’t check in. Returned 4 hours later and after a bit of a wait we eventually got our key. The beds are very comfy however in comparison to last years room it was much smaller this time. 
 They tried to charge a facilities fee which was fair enough however we did argue that the fee for the first day was a bit unfair given that we couldn’t get into our room never mind use any facilities. They did eventually agree not to charge us.
 We were also given a voucher for a free drink because of the inconvenience on arrival.

The heater did not work in my room, which caused some discomfort. I came home late from work each night during my visit and did not have the energy to have someone come to fix the device in my room. There was an extra blanket and it got me through. Room service was friendly and prompt. The area is not the best place to be at night. My colleague walked in the evening to Denny's and 7-11 and was harassed in both locations. Again, I give this hotel higher ratings because the friendly and helpful staff. Additionally, the complimentary airport shuttle is much appreciated.

"ビジネスで６泊しました。接客や清潔感は値段相応。良かった点は、お水がロビーに常時あること。朝は10時頃までコーヒーがある。（ホテルでは普通ですが）。
 気になった点は、長期滞在だったため、ランドリーがない（ルームサービスのクリーニングは可）こと。掃除の際に臭いのきつい洗剤を使用するため、ロビーが洗剤の臭いで気持ちが悪い。朝食は、隣接のバーで取ることができますが、朝食付きの部屋を予約した際に、課金なしで食べられるメニューは、12ドルのフルーツの盛り合わせ一人分とデニッシュ１個というアメリカにしてはかなり質素。これが１２ドル？？というくらい少ない量でした。他のメニューは、差額を支払えばオーダーすることができます。その際、コーヒーや飲み物代は別途請求されるので注意。
 周辺には本当に何もないので、食料は空港やサンフランシスコ市内で購入して持っていくのがオススメです。近場にUberで５分くらい走らせれば、ターゲットや飲食店が複数あるショッピング施設がありますので、ご利用ください。

After about 20 minutes, I finally found a spot three blocks away and had to walk back in the rain. You would think that a hotel where the front desk is staffed 24 hours a day would have their garage accessible the same hours. This is not a bakery or hardware store!.

"This is a lovely resort with beautiful pools and amenities. If you are staying here with the intention of going to the Disney parks though, transportation is very limited. 4 designated times for buses leaving to park and 4 designated times for returning. We ended up using Uber because their times were not fitting our schedules. Also, they try to upgrade everything thereby upping your original price. Other than this, a beautiful resort.

"I feel conflicted about my stay in the sense that the room was well kept but everytime we would return to the hotel room it had a strong unpleasant smell that wouldn't subside. The bed was comfortable and their bathroom products were a better quality than most. Night staff was more friendly than morning/day staff. Surrounding radius around the hotel feels a bit sketchy at night.

"Hotel is in a great location for exploring the city, next to penn station & subway stops. Easily within walking distance to Times Square and lots of tourist spots. We were rather disappointed by our “welcome” by staff at check in time, lucky if we were spoken five words to by the particular member of staff we were served by whereas other guests checking in at same time couldn’t have been welcomed any more warmly by other staff members. But aside from this initial experience the rest of the hotel staff we had contact with during our stay were very friendly and helpful. Our metro room was ample in size with plenty storage space although room decor particularly bathroom could do with a bit of a revamp as felt tired and run down.

Party going on in the banquet room so it was noisy. A lot of people in the halls being loud around midnight. Room was very dirty, hair all over sink and shower, carpets filthy, dusty rooms cob webs, tv remote didnt work, phone didnt work. Woke up to the smell of weed at 6 am. We just got up showered, and checked out. I have stayed here several times but this stay was not acceptable, wont be returning.

I was mostly not happy with the parking, which was not mentioned in the Hotels.com listing. $20 per night, and $12 per night if you signed up with Wyndham rewards, which I did. But, if I had known that parking was not free, I would have chosen a different hotel.

The hotel sits on a resort which is huge and is mostly time-share or holiday rentals. It offers a lot - gyms, lazy rivers, multiple pools, miniature golf but it is very spread out and was not what we were wanting or expecting. Having said that, the staff were lovely and the breakfast was delicious with wonderful choices... We wanted a hotel and got a hotel room in a holiday rental resort...

Walls were quite thin (glad I had my ear plugs) and although the room was 'clean', it was clear it was an older property. Lobby was nice and the staff was wonderful! Shuttle was on time as well, so that made catching our flight stressfree!

There was clearly a pet allowed in the room we were staying in and either the room wasn’t cleaned appropriately or at all or the guest never disclosed the fact that they were bringing in an animal. Regardless our room was infested with fleas. We found that out on the 2nd day of a 3 day stay when we began to suffer flea bites. The hotel had to clean all of our clothes and items and move us to another room.

"Wyndham Garden San Jose Airport was offering a really good rate compared to the other hotels in the area for the dates that I wanted. I stayed in 2 different rooms during my trip to the area and that probably improved my opinion of this hotel. 
 
 I could tell that this was an older property that was probably bought by Wyndham and fixed up a bit. The lobby didn't give me the greatest first impression. The furniture and accent color decor were fine, but I didn't love the low ceiling covered in mirrors.
 
 I walked through the pool area to my courtyard-facing room. The pool area was spotless and the garden looked nice. 
 
 My first room (166) was next to the housekeeping office which had its own noise and traffic. The interior of the room had some nice updates like the sink, the bed, and decor, but the painting seemed poorly done. Perhaps this room only had 1 coat of wall paint; it clearly needed another several to hide the scuff marks and stains. The bed was very comfortable.
 
 My second room (190) was also courtyard facing. The wall painting in that room looked much better and it actually made the whole room as a whole look better. 
 
 The in-room Wolfgang Puck's coffee was horrible.
 
 I really appreciated the shuttle service. They were fast and the drivers were very courteous. Although the reservation information asked me to call ahead to schedule the shuttle, I was told to call back as soon as I was with my bag and ready for pickup.

"The good: Customer service was very good, friendly. The room was spacious, the rain shower was strong. In general, the hotel was clean and well kept. 
 
 The bad: Cleaning service was inconstant, would sometimes clean better than other times. The bed would be made up in to different ways. There was a small stain on the bottom of the blackout blind that I can only guess is dried blood. The shower glass also leaked and the water looks like is water damaging the corner of the bathroom. 
 
 Lastly, I do not recommend using the keurig coffee maker. Clearly, previous guests have used the hotel tap water to make coffee and it can be tasted. Furthermore, I’m pretty sure I got stomach bug from drink from it.

"Great location, customer service needs some improvement. Check in is supposed to be at 3, we got there close to 4 and had to wait for our room. I had a question after we checked in and called the front desk, but no one ever answered. Parking is very challenging, you can hunt for street parking or pay $25 for valet service. Rooms are small (even a so called suite), but the beds are very comfortable and the view from our 10th floor room was great. The hotel is in a cute shopping area with a lot of restaurants and a busy night life vibe on a Saturday night. The complimentary breakfast was fantastic, with fresh scrambled eggs, sausage, and hash browns that were cooked perfectly. Cereal, bagels, toast, waffles, fresh fruit, coffee and juice were also available. The front desk service was my only complaint. We will likely stay here again.

He got very disrespectful and tried telling me I couldn’t stay parked there because other cars needed to get out, despite the fact I was leaving my keys.

Our view was to the pool and no fireworks. My 5 year old daughter was disappointed, and so were we. The blu restaurant downstairs that they rave about is nothing special. Food was terrible along with poor service. We had 8:45p.m reservation, we got there at 8:30p.m checked in with them. Around 8:55p.m I walked up to ask how long and they told me “ ah your table has been ready”. So why they didn’t call us? again poor service. The desert was uneatable “banana bread pudding”, no flavor, awful. The bathroom had mold on the bath curtains and on the wall. I’m surprised they have a 4 star ratings. I’m would give them a 2 . If you are used to quality service and deluxe amenities this is not the hotel for you.

The very curt front desk person then told me she would call me when my room was available. I checked my bag and went to dinner. No one called. Yes, the room was available when I arrived back at the hotel but the check bag person was no where to be seen. The guy waiting in front of me finally got mad and walked into the back and grabbed his bag him self. 
 
 This was a business trip for me so I ended up staying at the hotel for 5 days. Overall I found the bellhops friendly, though sometimes missing in action, and the front desk staff annoyed. The room was clean but the hotel was run down.

I asked her what time is he in and she said 10am. I come back at 10am and I ask her if the manager is in. She then answers me but whilst looking at her colleague. I spend all day waiting for the manager and finally he says he will change my room and put a heater in there.

"Loved this comfortable and elegant hotel. Really enjoyed the breakfast buffet in Tesoro Cove. Loved Deep Blu seafood grille, where they comped our desserts since we were there for our anniversary dinner - very unexpected and pleasant surprise. We got a family suite, with king bed, sofa and an alcove with a bunkbed. Our son loved that he had his own tv in the bunkbed alcove. Beds were very comfortable for my husband who has back problems. Pools were great, but I was otherwise unimpressed by ""children's activities"" which were nearly non-existent in the hotel. Just a tiny play area next to the pool of the hotel. They said there used to be an arcade in the hotel, but it was closed. They said we would need to go to the vacation club part of the resort to find arcades, playground and more pools, but our son was only with us 2 days in the hotel, so going to other parts of the resort didn't fit in our schedule. We were also surprised by the $22/day parking fees, which were not revealed on the hotels.com site. But overall, we would definitely recommend this hotel.

"I just spent a week at the New Yorker. The place has really gone downhill. At least half of the elevators were broken so wit times to go up and down were extremely long. The room cards constantly failed at both the room and the gym and I had to repeatedly go to the front desk to get new cards - and when I did the people at the reception glared at me like I was bothering them. The revolving door in the hotel lobby was malfunctioning constantly - it would suddenly stop and then star again and people kept getting whacked hard as they tried to negotiate their luggage through the thing to the street. There is no open wifi in the gym; there is a passworded wifi channel which you have to ask for but that doesn't work. Half of the hotel seems to have been converted into an urban dorm for nearby colleges, and that's okay but the kids are constantly getting onto the elevator and back out on another floor and it slows you down even further on top of the fact that half the elevators are broken. There are only two ice machines in the 40 floors and one of them was broken. This place needs a serious refurbishment (and probably new management).

"There are two types of rooms Hotel Rooms (doors open into the building) and Motel Rooms (doors open to the outdoors. The property is beautiful but open to the public from all angles; no security. I had 4 people knock on our door every morning claiming to be room-service even though I had the ""do not disturb"" sign hanging on the door handle. The first person was wearing appropriate uniform and pushing the refill cart - fine. The next three people all wore different colored scrubs-like uniforms with no name tags or wearing a hat. They tried to offer me rugs, wanted to know if I was checking out today, when I was leaving, and very specific info that didn't feel right giving out. If you stay, ask for an inward facing room for piece of mind.

This location tried charging my room prior to me checking in. I was paying with a different card when arriving. When we arrived we were informed that our reservation was cancelled at 2pm and the hotel was booked. Which tells me they cancelled my reservation in order to charge someone else a higher rate then what i reserved it for 1 month prior to this date. Expedia was great with helping us find a nice hotel in the same area for the same price.

"Ved bestilling havde vi bestilt et værelse på 15 sal med balkon. Ved ankomsten viste det sig de var i gang med at renovere vinduer og vi derfor ikke kunne benytte balkonen som vi havde ønsket. Dette blev vi ikke informeret om, og Hotels.com var heller ikke blevet informeret. Vi var i timelang dialog med hotels.com om dette. Hotels.com var villige til at hjælpe med relokation, det ville dog betyde vi skulle afse en dyrbar feriedag til dette Hotellet tilbød at tilbagebetale differencen mellem værelsespris på et værelse uden balkon. Dette endte vi med at tage imod, samt vi fik en voucher på en fri nat ved hotels,com. Vi kunne dog have sparet tid og ærgrelser hvis dette var blevet informeret og ordnet inden ankomst, Desuden endte det med at blive meget dyrt i restaurationspriser, da vi ikke kunne benytte værelsesfaciliteter/balkon til spisning som vi havde regnet med og håbet på, men måtte i stedet ud i byen og spise hvert måltid. Det løber op i New York. Rooftop terassen/restauranten som der også var reklameret med var også lukket. Så alt i alt syntes vi ikke vi fik refunderet det ændringen havde kostet os. Refunderingen var dog bedre end intet.
 Receptionisten så flink at låne os hans egen paraply, det kunne have været fint hotellet havde til udlån. Ellers syntes vi hotellet lå fint, let til aktiviteter, Brooklyn Bridge, Batteri Park, China Town, Little Italy, Soho, Metro station mm. Renovation af metroen betød dog at de ikke altid stoppede på vores station om aftenen !!

 Meget slidt værelse/bad, men rent og god størrelse.
 Havde bestilt værelse med udsigt, meget fint wiew direkte mod Empire State building. Lidt ærgerligt at vinduerne var meget beskidte, og dæmpede udsigten.
 Venligt personale. God ekspres udcheckning, de afleverede slutafregningen under døren den sidste nat, og hvis man er enig i regningen, smider man bare nøglekortene i en kasse i lobbyen og forlader hotellet. Det fungerede helt perfekt.

"Central location in New York, between two big railway stations, and in a very animated zone, this hotel could benefit more from a friendlier staff. Checking in and checking out too about 30 minutes each, not only because of too people at the desk (checking out) but also because of some interminable issues with the computer system (checking in). Otherwise, if you are OK with the (almost) permanent noise of syrens from police and fire trucks, and the crowd typical to this zone of New York, you would enjoy being close to almost everything in a veru circulated spot of the megacity. Our room was small and beds short, but this is perhaps we had a toom with a view (to Empire State Building). The other 2-bed room near ours, with no view, was apparently larger and more confortable. All together, this old (~ 90 years) and respectable hotel is what it is because of location. A nice surprise was the nearby Trattoria, a clean, quiet Italian cafe with direct access from the hotel.

"For an older hotel, The New Yorker was nice. The Staff was friendly and helpful. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. The room was clean. They very worst part of the hotel was the noise factor. We expected noise but not at that level. We were on the 27th floor, so we thought that would help with the noise. It felt like we were right on the 1st floor. We had to go and buy earplugs just to get to sleep. The hotel should invested in some kind of sound proofing. We have stayed in Times Square before and didn't have the horrible noise that we had at the New Yorker.

But the worst thing was the indefference and the unfriendly attitude of the Front Desk and Housekeeping staff when I asked them for a missing bag of snacks (worth $ 25.00) that -I am assuming- the cleaning lady took it by mistake. They never apologized for that . To be honest, I don't care about the snacks, I care more about the good service and positive attitude. The Front Desk employees were acting like they were doing a favor to the guests, when is the other way around. They only said ""We are going to find out what happened, we will call you soon"". I am still waiting... at least for an apology. Do not go to this hotel, Central Park will be a better place to sleep.

When traveling to other countries or cities, we rely heavily on a hotel's concierge. My wife & I politely asked the concierge to make a dinner reservation for us. His response was priceless...""You got a phone, so why don't you call the hotel yourself."" Apparently, the hotel concierge is highly compensated from the hotel and does not appreciate tips. We just used another hotel's concierge during our stay.

 They advertise parking butt charge you twenty five dollars a night. There is very very limited parking on the street.

El hotel esta descuidado, con las paredes de los pasillos manchadas y alfombras viejas. Puedo entender que deseen conservar su estilo vintage, pero le hace falta renovación. La ventaneria de las habitaciones es antigua, por lo que, aunque nuestra habitación estaba en el piso 21, se escuchaba todo el ruido de la calle. Sin embargo, creo que obtuve lo justo por lo que pagué, y la ubicación es realmente lo mejor.

It's a 15 minute walk to the parks and downtown Disney. We were able to walk back to the hotel for a midday refresher and nap. This helped hugely. There's also a CVS, Walgreens, Starbucks, Pieology, Subway, and several food places within walking distance. The hotel room is equipped with a microwave and fridge, perfect for saving left overs and making quick breakfasts. There's also the Anaheim Garden Walk that has shops, restaurants like the Cheesecake Factory, and Bubba Gump that is literally only a 5 minute walk away. I cannot emphasize how convenient this all was. I would also like to give a huge shout-out to the front desk staff. Wonderful customer service though-out our stay. Their house-keeping also kept our room incredibly fresh and tidy each day. They have several amenities and no hidden resort fees. Outside is a gorgeous heated pool and spa tub that I wish we got more use out of. Lastly, their underground parking garage reassured us that our vehicle was safe and sound. Thank you for ensuring our honeymoon was memorable! :) 
 
 Regards, 
 Christine and Christopher

About 10 min later I had a huge headache. 30 min. later I called down to let them know about the strong odor. I asked to switch floors and they were very accommodating, but it was too late.

This hotel resort has a grand 2-story mural of Queen Elizabeth I, over by the conference part of the resort; this is my favorite place to stay when we visit Orlando.

"The walls are paperthin and you can hear everything that is going on including street noise and talking in other rooms. The receptionist was not very friendly or welcoming when we arrived. When we checked into our rooms the cleaning staff was being very loud in the hallway and was shouting back and forth at eachother. When we came back to the hotel after dinner I could hear my neighbors shouting and having an argument saying ""Help, He's going to kill me!"" and screaming. I immediately went to the front desk and no one was there. I was afraid to go back to my room because of the shouting. The police were called and those people had to leave. The thermostat in my room did not work and the room stayed VERY COLD all night. I tried to switch it to heat and move the temperature up but it would not change. It stayed at 67 degrees all night. Overall it was not a good experience. I would not recommend.

My only complaint was the charge for luggage storage after check out. They charge$2 per bag. We were leaving them for 1 hour while we went to eat. We had just spent$1000 for a 3 night stay and then$8 more for 1 hour!!!! Ridiculous!!!! Left a very bad taste in my mouth. For that reason alone, we will never stay at The New Yorker again.

"The hotel's best asset was its location, close to Penn Stn. and an address I needed on 8th Ave. Long, slow line to check in. The 20th floor was dingy and scary, more like a tenament crime scene than a welcoming hotel. ""Art Deco"" means they haven't upgraded the place since the 20s. Room was small and barest minimum. Poor bed. A/C uncontrollable - awoke with a cold from the draft of the fan blowing onto the bed. Bath tub was nice, but amenities were stingy. Insulting, paying their rates, to have cheap, unremovable hangers, no breakfast AND pay a money-grab ""facilities fee"" on top. For what? Basically to ""use"" the hotel one has paid $300+ to sleep one night in. Unimpressed with WYNDHAM hospitality. MUCH BETTER, more luxurious stay at HILTON Embassy Suites two days later.

"De ligging van het hotel is op zich goed. Vlakbij een metrostation en op loopafstand van Times Square. Maar dat is dan ook het enige positieve.
 Aan de negatieve kant staat dat het in een onaangename straat ligt. Het hotel zelf is zeer gedateerd. De kamer die wij hadden was klein, nee erg klein. Zelfs voor New Yorkse begrippen was de kamer erg klein. Nauwelijks bergruimte. Er was maar een kleine kledingkast. Die stond stijf tegen het bed aan, wel een stukje van de muur af, want anders kon je niet bij de lichtknopjes!. De deur van die kast en de deur van de badkamer konden ook niet tegelijk open. De airco maakte ontzettend veel lawaai. Die kon je dus ook 's-nachts niet aan hebben, waardoor het buitengewoon warm en benauwd was (de ramen konden ook niet open). De badkamer was net als de kamer een miniatuur-badkamer en bovendien beschimmeld. De wandjes waren ook zo dun dat je de buren zowat letterlijk kon verstaan. De algemene staat van het hotel was erg gedateerd. Het heeft op zijn minst een grondige opknapbeurt nodig, maar beter is een algehele renovatie. Al met al geen aanrader. Het is zeker geen vier-en-een-halve ster. Op zijn best twee sterren.

The bathroom was dirty. We had to unplug the AC to turn it off because the off button was not working.

"I chose the New Yorker because it was close to Penn Station and we were taking the Train back to our home town. However, my base fee for the room was $228.00 and by the time they added on taxes and fees it was $300.00. I was very unhappy about that. The hotel responded on a timely basis with the comment it was stated in the confirmation email there would be added fees etc. Never did I realize it would be nearly $75.00 in taxes and fees.

"This hotel is NOTHING LIKE THE PHOTOS!! This hotel is a motel, small rooms, old, old, old. When I booked with Hotels.com, I thought I was getting a suite (probably not the fault of the property, but rather of the website) and upon arrival at the room, which is a half mile drive away from the front desk, we found a tiny motel room, with no tv remote that worked (so we had only one channel to watch!), a door that would not lock, and the dirtiest sidewalks imaginable. Then we discovered they charge a “resort fee” of $24 - I don’t think so! It was removed. Only two can eat for breakfast so prepare to pay for the kids! But the breakfast was otherwise very nice - great service and yummy.

"Great lobby. Very beautiful and ornate. Its like your going back in time to a grand venue, but then you go to your rooms and see they haven't been touched since the 60s. The bathrooms were very unclean with paint chipped and cracks in the floor. Some rust around the shower handles and a very old toilet I'd expect to see in a old public restroom. The room also had a faint smell of cigarette smoke. This place is just old. Not what I expected at all when I walked through the lobby. And not what I expected from a Wyndham.

The hotel is a great location and it has 2 great restaurants inside of it. The hotel is definitely a NY landmark, therefore, it isn't very modern. Also, the windows aren't sound proof. So make sure you take earplugs.

On the site it says there’s a laundry room, but we asked and there isn’t only laundry service, so dumb. The stay was good though. They need a sign on the door that goes out to the pool because on the hall it shows you where to go, but when we got to the door it had no sign and we weren’t sure if we can open the door thinking it might set off an alarm...

 Pros. Close to the parks. Uber is under 10 bucks to get to Epcot and Hollywood studios. There is a shuttle that runs also which is good. The hotel has things to do as well. There’s the lazy river, pools, mini golf and grill areas. 
 
 Cons. No free parking. You’ll be paying 28 per day to park at the hotel. Restaurants are crazy expensive. The breakfast buffet, while pretty good, was 25 per person. And their seafood restaurant was very nice expensive as well.

Aside from very thin walls, the acoustics for the room were horrid where you could hear the laundry room noise from 3 doors down as the housekeeping staff were washing linen and preparing their maids carts. Blinds on the windows were broken and wouldn't close properly. Electrical outlet on the desk was broken, threshold beneath the door provided too much of a gap where concern for insects entering room was prevalent. Calcium buildup on shower head was thick, so maybe a dip in CLR would help. Overall disappointed.

Las ventanas no cerraban bien y se metía ruido y aire de la calle. El aire acondicionado no funcionaba bien ya que aunque puedas poner la temperatura que quieres, funciona con el aire general de todo el hotel y pues no sirve de nada.
 Si buscan un hotel moderno y cómodo, está no e ala opción, si eso no es importante pero si es importante la ubicación esta es la elección ya qe esta pegada ala estación de metro que te lleva a todos lados.

We could tell there were some nice upgrades to the room, (floor tiles, beautiful sink, and mirror, etc). But there were other areas that needed improving. (Bathtub had yellow stains, cabinets/shelves had heavy chipping, the hallway smelled like fresh paint, we could hear conversations and music through the walls very clearly) Also, I was not able to open the sliding glass door to the deck without the help of my husband. (The rollers were broken). So, overall it was an okay stay. I would find a different hotel to stay in the future though.

"My wife does not like elevators. So so we asked for the impossible, a room on the lower floor, with a view. The reception staff were very nice and explained that the lowest floors were given over to students and the hotel proper really stated on floor 20. 
 In the end, the large elevators were fine and although we were on floor 22. We did have a room with a view over the Hudson.
 The Hotel is historic 1930, perhaps not as huge as it was in the 1930's when it had over 2000 rooms but it retains many of the decorative features and style. It's been refurbished a few times. It does show signs of its age, but that is the character.
 Brown paint, deco carpets, a little shabby but that is nicer than some corporate slick hotel. (Yes noisy plumbing, the shower pressure is excellent but it does have a downside if someone next door showers late at night).
 The rooms are modest, some quite small I gather.
 Comfort was good, a nice bed, good linen, sheets changed every day. Housekeeping excellent.
 Noisy air con but it worked. Great shower/bath. 
 So a recommended hotel. With excellent service.

On the positive, the airport shuttle was easy and only took a few min to get to the airport.

"This place was terrible considering it was a Wyndham property. The room was the size of a postage stamp with barely enough room for the bed. We had booked for 3 days and a flight cancelation caused us to arrive the next day and even though I called the hotel ahead of time not asking for a refund our room was unavailable when we got there. The next day we get back late at approximately 1:30 in the morning and discover we had no housekeeping done that day. So at 1:30 in the morning we have to go down to the front desk to ask for towels and we were told that housekeeping does not clean the room unless it is requested. According to hotels.com this should have been included with the room as I have never heard of a regular hotel making you request housekeeping service. They had water coolers in the lobby and down stairs outside of the breakfast area that were never filled however you could buy a $2 bottle of water from a vending machine that they keep filled. The location of this hotel was also not very convenient if you are going into the city for tourism. I don't put that on them but it should be noted it's inconvenient

"The bathroom cleanliness left quite a bit to be desired. There’s mold/mildew in the grout and around the lip of the sink/under mount that’s visible in plain sight. Pretty gross. Two of the rings for the shower curtain were ripped and barely holding the curtain up. We stay here on average 10x per year so I’m surprised to see some of this. We still love the hotel and will stay here again, of course, but it makes me wonder how clean things really are.

"We stay here on average about 10x per year. So we really love the hotel and the amenities. The only thing I’ve noticed over the years is the lack of maintenance and upkeep in the rooms. Mold/mildew in the grout, around the sinks and in the overflow drains. Shower curtains and curtains stained and in disrepair. Yuck.

"Booked a courtyard room with two queen beds, ended up with a room towards the street with two twin beds. The light from the outside made it feel like day time in the room even with the curtains and blinds closed. I could hear the neighbors talking outside all the time. At 2am, people were coming home from the bars and were crazy loud. I even wear ear plugs and could tell you their whole conversation. I stepped out to ask them to move away from my room since we had an early flight. Thankfully they were not confrontational. The air conditioner sounded like a plane taking off everyone it kicked on. I wouldn’t recommended staying here if you actually need to catch sleep.

"This hotel had been recommended to us by two people so we hadn’t looked at any other hotels. We stayed for 9 nights. The room was not very big but we didn’t spend much time in it. The best part was the location. It is very near Penn station and Madison Square Garden. Lots of places to eat nearby.

"I chose this hotel as I had previously stayed there on my last visit over a decade ago and it was exactly as I remembered it. The location is ideal for city sightseeing as its on the corner of 34th and 8th only a block down from Times Square and 3 from the Empire State Building. Penn Station is only about 2 minutes walk from the hotel giving easy access to the subway and train network. The hotel itself is very comfortable its by no means the most up to date hotel but everything was clean it all worked and I was very happy to have this as my base for my 4 night stay, it was also quiet enough for me to be able to sleep and recover from a hard days sightseeing. The staff were all friendly and professional and I have to say if I was to go back I would have no problem staying here again.

"There were bugs in my hotel bed. The family scene meant dealing with other people’s kids which is never good. The 2nd floor rooms have some kind of flooring that made the people sound like they were tap dancing as they were walking circles around their room for 45 minutes. Every time the second floor toilet flushes the toilet on the first floor will run and it’s pretty loud. I would NOT waste my money on this metaphorical “pig with lipstick.”

"This is a motel. Not at all the Wyndham we are used to! The floors were covered in sand, the beds were not clean and also had gritty stuff in between the sheets. The blinds don’t block out the light so you have car headlights coming in the window all night long. The motel is close to dining and bars, which is great other than the fact there are patrons outside LOUD and banging on the floors and up and down the stairs after 3am. I didn’t want to bathe my kids in the bath tub/shower, and that’s saying a lot after a whole day at Disney. The AC wouldn’t go lower than 75 and was struggling with even that temp even after midnight. We will not be visiting this hotel again, EVER. Spend the extra $25 and go to another hotel on I Drive to get a clean room.

"If you are thinking about getting the ""Breakfast Included"" option for this hotel- don't. They only provided fruit that wasn't even that fresh and a pastry. I was expecting better considering I payed and extra $10 for each person to get breakfast. If I hadn't gotten the ""Breakfast Included"" option, I could have gotten the continental breakfast for $12 which wouldn't have been half bad. Housekeeping was okay. The front desk was helpful in providing more toiletries and the room was okay. Wished it had better lighting and that the beds were actually queens and not fulls. It was a decent place to lay our heads at the end of the day. Liked that it was right next to two highways: to San Francisco and LA.

"The New Yorker has a beautiful lobby, central location and friendly staff, but that is where the charm ends. The rooms themselves are old and dingy. The windows really need to be replaced as they let in way too much noise. I was on an upper floor and while I understand that NYC is loud, double pane windows would go a long way and be a green initiative. The bathroom had peeling paint and no fan for moisture build up. The shower was very low, I am 5'5'', so anyone who is taller than that will have to stoop. There are weird stains on the curtains and a very firm old mattress for bed. The rooms are tiny but that would be okay if they weren't so dingy. I think this place survives due to the name, because tourists will flock to it, and the location. Otherwise, it is really not worth the price. The amenities fee is also a rip off, as there are very few amenities. They do not even have coffee in the rooms. I will stay somewhere else when I come back.

"Parking was charged when we checked out, which we were told that it was free in the beginning when we checked in. Bathroom had an odor, there was 2 damp towels and a stain on the bathtub, and the toilet had an issue with flushing. The hotel staff fixed this issue, but the next day we still smelled a little bit of the odor and the toilet still had the flushing issue.

"Checked in at 11:30pm. Found that the door handle in room is broken. Brush teeth only to find out that the sink does not drain. Couldnt get it to drain. Had to use my cell phone to call front desk to report because phone does not work. By now it around 12:30am. I just want to get some rest. Only takes a few minutes to find that the bed is itchy. Horrible experience in about one hour.

"I thoroughly enjoyed my 2-night stay @ the New Yorker. At the very outset, receptionist staff was superbly courteous and professional. The room was large with many windows for street-viewing and daylight. Of course the hotel location is fantastic, with many historical sites and public transportation in close proximity. I highly recommend the New Yorker for an enjoyable stay in the city.

"Super convenient location if you want to be near the A, C, E lines and Penn Station. About 10 blocks to Times Square. Room was not the most comfortable - hard wood floors felt grimy, AC was almost unbearably loud (we had to sleep without it) and walls are thin. The upside is that the hotel staff were very polite and accommodating and tried to help us resolve the issues. Overall a good choice if you need a basic hotel in the middle of Manhattan.

"The hotel is really convenient to food and centrally located to everywhere in Queens. If you're looking for convenient to Manhattan this is not the place. If you're looking for peace and quiet with access to some decent food choices and located not far from Citi Field, US Open or just family and friends in Queens - this is the right place for you. It's a mostly no frills hotel. It's clean and quiet and has a decent bed. Access in the direct walking area to food 24 hours a day. I would definitely stay here again.

"Hotel itself was nice and clean, however the staff was terrible. We checked in late, after midnight and my wife and I had our 2 little kids so we battled unloading all of our luggage and kids while all the hotel staff just starred at us without offer to help. Finally, the wife and I just grabbed the bell boy's cart, loaded all our luggage while carrying our kids as they had fallen asleep. To top it off, the gate for the parking lot was malfunctioning so the key fob wasn't working, so we had to buzz the intercom every time and in some cases, we didn't get someone and had to wait and continue to buzz the intercom.

"The entrance & lobby seemed nice. 
 After entrring our two rooms, we immediately saw the drips, dust, hair, damage on all our internal doors & bathroom. At 10:30pm a loud party with music blaring, started in the room connected to us. They were letting at least a dozen guys slip into the exit door for this party. We went to the desk to complain, we came back to being locked out of one of our rooms & no one doing anything to stop the party. Five trips to the front desk in our pj’s (walking around a big spill that no one would clean up) cound not get the door lock to work. It’s now 11:30pm. Party still raging and us huddled with the person who is locked out of their room. A security guy came to help. He was unable and we had to wait 20min for someone to drive to the hotel with their master key to re-set the lock. After I ask security why no one has stopped the party, he pounds on the door. The party raged on till past midnight and we were relocated. We never saw the party get stopped. The next day we were locked out of one of the new rooms and informed we were given the wrong keys. They swapped our room keys so each group stayed in rooms, that were in the names of the other. My sister needed to check out a day before me so, it was a long process to get it straightened out. It made us miss a family breakfast before family left and I returned to my room to be locked out AGAIN. We did not finish our stay. Horrible experience.

"My stay at this hotel was unacceptable. The first night the air conditioner broke around 10:30 at night. I called the front desk and they sent over an engineer to fix it. He was completely unprofessional and cursed in front of my 6 year old son when he made a mistake repairing the unit. The ac began leaking freon and we were told it was okay to stay in the room. After researching breathing in freon, I found out it can be toxic. The repair took around 40 minutes and we had to wait outside the room at 11pm. I called the front desk and they were completely unhelpful with the situation and they could not offer us another room. The next day my family returned to the hotel from being out all day and housekeeping failed to stock any towels in the room. I went to call the front desk and our phone was broken. While at the pool- there were zero pool towels stocked and ducks were swimming the the pool. The pool was filthy and the staff was completely unresponsive to the guests.

"Check in was easy going had a room available for early check in which I was happy with. However, three issues 1) the first room which was in bldg 5 did not have a refrigerator which I was suppose to have so went to front desk to ask if I can be moved closer to the pool. They put me in bldg 8 not too far from the pool. However, my daughter saw bugs crawling on the bed we thought ok one or two but instead we moved the pillows and there were quit a bit. So we were disgusted went back to the front desk and showed them pics of the bug. They couldn’t move us because they were booked and said they will send someone. Maintenance saw the bugs and came to spray around both beds and said someone coming to change the linen. We were skeezed out we didn’t sleep well because of that 3) I went to use the laundry room in bldg 8 and I put like $6 dollars in coins and the washer did not work notified the front desk they told me to go to bldg 9/10 to wash and they reimbursed me $4 dollars. Also, the sink was clogging. Just a mess I was disappointed with the rooms never experienced that before. Staff was really nice and understanding though but still very dissatisfied with Wyndham Resort at 8001 Internationa

"All in all a very pleasant stay in this iconic hotel, however a couple of things let it down. Firstly the lack of a thermostatic shower with just hold/cold taps to try and get the balance right meant showers took longer than necessary and left you at the mercy of other people’s water usage. Second the lack of coffee making facilities was another disappointment in what was otherwise a pleasant stay. Also read the booking small print, as there is a $29 PER NIGHT service charge added in, which I wasn’t prepared for at check out.

 There was construction that happened at 7:30am in front of the building. If you want to sleep in, that will be a problem because of the noise level. The location is a shady and dangerous neighborhood. Beware walking at night and also it was a filthy street.

"O Hotel tem uma localização excelente, mas falha em comodidades básicas como frigobar inexistente no apartamento. O espaço dos quartos é minúsculo e você tem a sensação de aperto. Mesmo um casal. Há muitos funcionários que não são simpáticos e chegam até à descortesia. Por exemplo, para subir nos elevadores alguns funcionários ficam no caminho exigindo a apresentação do keycard (o cartão que abre o quarto). Até aí tudo bem. Mas essas pessoas não têm preparo para lidar com os hóspedes. São mal humorados e grosseiros.
 Outra coisa lamentável são as taxas extras contadas pelo hotel além da estadia. Cerca de 75 dólares a mais por dia. O que não é exatamente uma atitude transparente do hotel vez que tais acréscimos são obrigatórios. Me hospedei nesse hotel duas vezes. Tive a mesma impressão na primeira vez, mas dei o benefício da dúvida. Tudo confirmado. Não me hospedarei mas nesse hotel. Tem uma ótima localização. Mas o custo beneficio não vale a pena.

"I had originally booked a King-sized bed for my room. Upon check-in, I went to the room and the bed was definitely not a King. I was on my way to a concert and didn't have time to talk to the front desk. When I returned from the concert Shayna was at the desk and I asked her about the room. She was so friendly, and so understanding! She was able to quickly change my room to a correct size and even had a pull-out couch! Thank you again for your help!

"The beds were awesome! They were comfortable and soft and yet not too soft. The shower was also great. But there needed to be another towel rack near the sink to hang a wash/face cloth and hand towels. I also liked the gated parking garage, it felt very safe. All in all, though, a very nice room.

"Pros: Service charge included phone calls home 
 Cons: Rooms are too small
 Location: Location is good as it's easy to get to the main tourist points. Metro subway right outside door, Empire State Building a short walk (10 mins) Dinner attached (Tick Tock) offers good food Resort fees include unlimited phone calls to anywhere in the world as long as it's a land line which was a good addition. However, the rooms are very small, tiny bathroom and if like me you live out your suitcase be prepared to give up access to one side of the bed. Hotel is within walking distance of the Empire State and Macey's plus there is a metro station right outside. The $3 per bag charge for leaving your luggage on your last day is a bit steep. Over all a good stay and staff were very courteous.

"I still have mixed feelings about this hotel. 
 We arrived early on Saturday and were told they would call us when our room was ready -- they NEVER called and we went back around 4 or 5 and tons of people were checking in and going straight to their room. We re-checked in and were given absolutely one of the worst hotel rooms I have EVER been placed in. It was extremely small, around 100sq feet ?? Hot water was not working, old tv on a tiny counter, no room at all for luggage, no refrigerator, no coffee pot, no NOTHING!! Absolutely not worth the price of the room --EVER!!
 We sent in an online review that night and the manager called our room and told us she would have us switched the next day. However when doing what we were told to do the hotel staff was not aware of the request so that was another ordeal. 
 We were then told by the staff to come back after 4 and they would have a new room ready for us. We showed up around 4:30 and were told ""we were lucky because they just happened to have 1 room????""
  Well, I have a problem with this because we were told we would have a better room but now it was ""just our luck""?? The next room was much better! I do feel sorry for anyone paying the price and getting the room we had to begin with. 
 Location was a good central location for what we needed.
 If I need a good central hotel again I will consider staying here, but I will call directly to see what kind of room they are placing us in before hand.

However, 13 days past the amount of $234.15 is still in the pending status on my credit card.

"This resort is broken up into 2 parts. The Wyndham Grand which is the Hotel and the resort which is the Timeshare part where the full suites are. You have access to all of the of the full resort however when it comes to room charges you can only do your room charges on the hotel side. I made that mistake one day during my stay and went to one of the pool bars on the other side of the resort on the timeshare side and tried to charge the drink to my room and they could not find my room number . I had to go back later to bring my payment later in the day. The staff goes out of your way to be kind and helpful and they gave me an upgrade at no charge since it was my birthday and also a late checkout on the day I was checking out as well. It was a very enjoyable stay on the whole. I would recommend to anyone who has a family or just a couple who wants a romantic weekend away. Lovely hotel.

Our associates stated that it did not look like the photos, the AC was making some weird noises, and that they did not get much sleep when they checked in. We contacted the hotel once they informed us, and spoke with Adam the operations manager, and he was helpful in assisting us.

"Stayed here for a family vacation, hotel was amazing, staff was amazing. Indoor pool was freezing so we couldn’t enjoy it. There wasn’t a fridge or microwave in the room but that didn’t spoil the vacation. Only downfall for this hotel was the fact parking was NOT free, which was a tough pill to swallow at checkin. We felt it should’ve be disclosed, I’ve rechecked my booking several times to verify, no mention of parking charges. So this should be rectified immediately in our opinion. Otherwise there is nothing wrong with this hotel, definitely would stay again!

 We had to call the front desk to send someone to ask them to be quiet at 12:30am.(The front desk acted like they had not heard them, which wasn't possible since the music was so loud that everybody could hear them)
 They were quiet for sometime and again at 3am they started getting loud.
 The only thing I wasn't happy with hotel management was, they did not take care of the situation until we called them.

I booked it on a whim (our go to was booked out) for our Disney stay, and not going to lie.. was a little worried - BUT this hotel, staff and overall everything went beyond our expectations! We arrived 2hrs before check in, and they still got us in no problem! The front desk staff have always greeted us with smiles, remembered us and our daughter and always made great small talk (you know that forced one is the worst.. but this was definitely not that!)! The rooms are so nicely remodeled and spacious! Good size bathrooms and the waterfall shower is amazing as well! Always cleaned on time, and always set up our daughters Disney stuffed toys on the bed and blanket for us to come back too! Long story short - you WILL NOT be disappointed here at all! I can honestly say this hotel is now our favorite and we will only stay here! Thank you guys for making our trip smooth :)

 We got back to the room at midnight and our 5 year son was a sleep in the car ride, I put him down in the bed and noticed alot of Ants between the sheets. I quickly removed him and shake the ants of the bed, and we noticed the whole room was infested by ants.i called the front office spike to him explain out concern. He sad he will. Send someone over.. 30-40 min later I called again.and again.was told we will send someone over.. nothing g again. I called to ask for different sheets. And they decided to hung up on us and never picked up the phone again. Finaly at 120 a guy give us 4 new sheets and we had no choice but to spend the night in uncomfortable room full of ants and it was the worst experience ever and we will never return to Wyndham again.

The rooms are clean, quiet and the bed is very comfortable. The business center and fitness center are extremely accommodating. Easy walks to food venues, times square and cabs are attainable with a doorman to assist. All in all, even though this is one of the oldest hotels in town, it is a great place to stay. The nostalgic ambiance only adds to the experience.

However there kids room were on the opposite side of the hotel then they were despite complaining they said they were sold out and couldn't bring the kids room closer. I mean seriously these kids are 6, 10 ,and 12 they need adult supervision. Basically they each had to sleep in one room. 
 As for our room we were facing a stone wall and what we had a view of was hundereds of cigarette buds from the balconies above us.

If this poses any issue whether you're a senior, have mobility issues or otherwise, you might seriously want to reconsider this choice.

"Met a woman that was checking into The WYNDHAM NEW YORKER foR the first time I assured her her checking experience would be great , after hearing her last 2 1/2 hour check in experience at another hotel inthe same vicinity. Checking in at about 5:30 to 6:00 after a very long day we walked into 3 receptionists at the counter 4 people on line ,another staff member took myself to another desk and we both were checked in within 3 -5 minutes!! She was amazed & so grateful for their professionalism, and said from now on I will always book the New Yorker !! She also said I cannot believe I have put up with such poor service for 6 years from the other hotel!!! Thank you WYNDHAM NEW YORKER !!

"Upon arrival our check in was extremely long. there were two front desk staff, the staff member that assisted my family was very slow, and refused help from co-worker. My family and I had been on the road all day and was exhausted. The staff member act as if the check in was confusing and begin to get frustrated. This facility need to work on there staff customer services skills. Secondly the bed cover on the bed had soil spots, management was notified and phoned for someone to change the sheets. My family and I went to dinner. When we arrived back to the room , the sheets still were not changed.
 The Wyndam is nice , im not going to down grade the hotel. Our stay was not a complete disaster, one of the staff members accommodated my children for the extended wait time, some of the staff were friendly and helpful. The location is right off the freeway, there is a trail nearby , and stores within 5 minutes.

"This hotel is well kept and the staff are courteous and professional. The location is great because you have a shopping area and movies right behind in walking distance. It is also a nice area that feels safe in Queens. I only wish parking was an amenity to the hotel because parking is difficult and if you use their parking its $25.00 a day. I feel that is expensive and you already paying for your stay.

They said they could give us the first floor no balcony room. It took the representative 45 minutes to find us a room that didn’t even have a balcony on it. The bathtub had what appeared to be pubic hairs around the edge of it . Then they charged us a resort fee of $40 when it was only supposed to be $24.

"PROS - Very friendly and helpful check-in, Great resort layout with a lot of walking areas in a park-like setting, beds were comfy, tons of restaurants and stores in walking distance, having 2 pools was nice.
 
 CONS - Service at Gatorville is mediocre at best, ""Pool bar"" is enclosed now which defeats the purpose of a pool bar, Pool itself is pretty dirty and we never saw anyone tending to it, had to go search for pool towels each of the 3 days we were there, Bathrooms in the Premium rooms are tiny, Kid's Playground has been ""closed for repairs"" for 2 years now!
 
 Overall, we were a little disappointed. Having stayed here many times before, there were a lot of little things that have slipped through the cracks. Garbage cans were full, no towels, didn't see any workers walking through the grounds cleaning up the whole time we were there. We stay here for the location.

"I like that they cleaned our room everyday day. I also liked that it had a refregidare. But being a family oriented hotel it should have a small microwave, in the rooms, because when you have little ones it wasnt a good idea to have to walk to the lobby to heat up some food for them. I dislike that the parking available was very limited when events are held. I believe that you should have an assigned parking with your stay. Also the event that was there was very loud in the pool till about 2 in the morning and they were loud, there should be a limit to that. The action were unfair to young ones around and the pool couldnt be access for 3 days. Also they should have a well established kiddie pool area with sprinklers or something fun because not all kids can enjoy the big pool. Also a long time ago there were floats available and games to play on the premises at the pool. Aside from that the staff and place was nice.

"The hotel was beautiful, but rooms could’ve been more clean. Housekeeping never cleaned the bath tub, changed our sheets one time during a 4 night stay, never refilled our bath linens, and everything was dusty. Headboards had scratches and tears. Only one phone worked. No microwave in room. Glasses for drinks were only changed out once. Carpenters working on upper floors early in the morning due to remodeling. When booking through Expedia, there is no mention of the resort fees and parking fees. Total resort fee was $75 for 4 night stay plus $22.95 per night for parking. There is no other option for parking. My card was charged $375 upon arrival for deposit. 20% was added to room service which is of course pricey. Upon check in we were told our room with one bed was booked, but they had another room with two king size beds. Not a problem, but I want what I paid for. Too many hidden fees for too many issues and the staff really treats it as a minor inconvenience, but for the amount I paid I expect a clean room and better service. The staff members were very kind, but I feel as though they didn’t take our complaints seriously and I felt our complaints were pretty legitimate. Looks can be deceiving.

The hotel is old and rundown, and the front desk service was subpar and flat out rude. I am frequently in NYC and every time stay in midtown manhattan, and would never stay again at this hotel!! The hotel gives Wndyham a bad name and I would think twice before using a Wyndham hotel in the future. There are several other hotels I have stayed in the area and all of them are far superior to this place! Do not stay here you will be severely disappointed! Good location however, just very poor all around other than that!!!

"I rarely post reviews but felt it necessary to post about our recent stay. Pictures are deceiving! I expected a clean, spacious room. What we encountered was a musty room with stained bed skirts and stained comforter on one of the beds. The furniture is old and instead of drawers there are cubbies to store your clothes. Although I called for hangers since there were none, they were never delivered so we bought some at the nearby RiteAid. The safe gave us problems and we had to call for service twice (they were prompt in responding for the safe). Although there were four of us, only two towels were provided and after calling three times for additional towels, it took them over a half hour to bring them since ""they were still drying"". After the first day we wanted to check out but thought we were really only there to sleep and even with that thought, I felt even the basic amenities were lacking. Two positives: great water pressure and the beds/pillows were comfy. Staff were friendly but I highly doubt if we will return to this hotel.

"Not the best place. On the plus side: it is easy and convenient to find, and next to the Coyote Creek Trail which was nice for running in the morning. On the negative side: the hallway smelled like pot, spots on the carpet, not a comfortable bed. Our room was on the freeway side of the hotel and it was noisy throughout the night. There was a lot of noise from guests in the hallway as well. Breakfast for us was included and it tasted good and had good service. If it is not included in your booking, it would be overpriced.

"Convenient location for JFK; friendly staff; free street parking if a spot available (c/w $25 valet); reasonable food and drink options available within walking distance (mostly chains). Rooms ok - no carpeting, which is a positive for those with allergies, etc. Main issue was the SMELL! The first room I was given reeked of stale cooking oil (there is a kitchenette with a cook top; clearly well used). Smoke/CO2 alarm also going off, so I asked for a different room. Second one - no alarm beeping, but same stale cooking smell. Stuck with this one, but woke with the stench in my nostrils. Not pleasant. Also a call-out to the mystery shower. I have stayed in many hotels around the world, but I just could not work out how to use it. Took a nice bath instead, but not really the point.

"I wasn't thrilled with the $20 per night parking fee and no real other option. Rooms were on the smaller side....a bit cramped. We had an issue with the air conditioning in the room. We were cold when it was on and warm as soon as it clicked off. Beds were comfortable. Shower was good. Sink in bathroom was very low pressure and poor design.

"I have stayed at this resort before and again had an excellent visit. It is beautifully laid out and in a perfect location. Our reservation included the breakfast buffet, which we looked forward to every day. On Friday night, there was a convention going on and I could not find parking anywhere near our room. So, I drove to the entrance and a very helpful and kind attendant led me to a parking area in his golf cart and then drove me back to our building. He remembered me the next morning and knew exactly where my car was. His friendly service is a testament to the way the hotel is run. A big thank you to the Wyndham Resort for our stay - we'll be back.

"My fiancé and I booked this hotel for our anniversary and for the location. When we arrived we were tacked on an $80 resort fee which was in the tiny tiny small print. Breakfast was $16 per person. We had to park on top of a hill in between trees, due to an anime convention that weekend. Illicit drug use by the pool, and security did nothing. We had blood stained comforter, and house keeping didn’t do anything. At the bar in the lobby, the bartender added another dollar on top of what i tipped because their “policy” adds another dollar for manual tips added to a credit card receipt. Called service and was rudely treated and transferred to a manager on a Sunday. Obviously they aren’t there. Called back and was yelled at and mistreated. The worst experience I’ve ever had.

We had 2 beds, a sitting area with a couch and ottoman and little table which was awesome to have so much room. They all gave us great recommendations and advise. Customer service was fantastic! The only thing I'd change is the door handle in bathroom was broke and the tiled shower really could use an update or fix grout.

"Challenging stay. I arrived and the attendant was unable to answer my questions due to a language barrier, the staff nearby attempted to answer my questions but appeared annoyed to help. Upon arriving to my room, my bed was not made. Also, as I was attempting to fall asleep, the cleaning staff were extremely loud as they were cleaning rooms, so I had to kindly go out of my room to ask them to keep it down, to which they laughed and continued being loud. My flight had been cancelled and I had dealt with a lot of annoying travel issues, I simply wanted to come to a hotel and relax, feel welcomed and safe, that wasn’t my experience. Every phone call I made to the front desk to ask for help with the room, or the cleaning staff, was never answered. I actually had to call from my cell phone to the front desk to have someone answer. Overall such a disappointment and tremendous lack of customer service.

"This property, on the outskirts of San Jose, is readily accessible to Silicon Valley and beyond by several convenient freeway on-ramps. The staff was extremely kind, patient, and helpful. The televisions in the first two rooms I was assigned did not work. The carpet was badly stained in the third room (249), where I decided nevertheless to remain. The furnishings in all rooms are well past fully-depreciated, a bit banged-up, and oddly mismatched. WiFi was spotty. The pool and spa were welcome but could use a good scrub around the edges. Clientele was varied, from retired people to families to laborers. Quiet neighborhood. The restaurant across the parking lot offered good variety and quality.

"The room was great: clean, spacious, comfortable and stylish. Rain showerhead in the bathroom, free Kurig coffee/tea bar in the room. The hotel is within walking distance from Disneyland which made it super accessible after a late night/long day of fun. There’s tons of restaurants around it. Easy access to the underground parking garage. Friendly and helpful staff. (They even gave us a late check out, which we greatly needed.) But my absolute favorite thing about it was the bed. We had a king size bed that you just sunk into. Probably one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. I wish I could have taken that bed home with me.
 
 They were doing some work to the entry way when we arrived but the sound didn’t bother us as our room was facing the opposite side. My only complaint was that the hand held shower attachment leaked and didn’t work. Other than that, our stay was amazing.

Only disappointment was the $22/day hotel parking fee that they conveniently do not mention during check-in. Didn’t see this during booking the trip; had to look through several links after the fact to find. Would of been nice to know before we received over $100 bill under our door on the last day just for parking!
